You can download standard wallets from https://ton.org/wallets.

These are convenient, tested and secure wallets.

## Troubleshooting

### Basic

* Make sure your wallet is downloaded from https://ton.org/wallets.

* Make sure you have your recovery words backed up. If not, click on "Back up wallet" and make a backup.

* Make sure that config URL is https://ton.org/global-config-wallet.json and blockchain ID is **mainnet** in Settings of your wallet.

* If your settings are different, enter the correct values.

* If you cannot enter **mainnet** into blockchain ID - update your wallet from https://ton.org/wallets.

### Everything above has been done, but the wallet does not connect

* Just reopen the wallet app. When the application starts, it will choose another lite server.

### A long time ago I had a wallet, I have recovery words, but the wallet does not connect

* Oh, you're a TON veteran. Some lite servers may not have such a long history, so you'd better use the archive node when you first log in.

* Make sure your wallet is downloaded from https://ton.org/wallets.

* In wallet Settings in config URL enter https://ton.org/global-config-archive.json and **mainnet** in blockchain ID. Apply settings.

* After the wallet is successfully synchronized - put in settings in config URL https://ton.org/global-config-wallet.json again.
