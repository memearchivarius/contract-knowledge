# TL-B
TL-B stands for "Typed Language - Binary". It is used to describe scheme of (de)serialization of objects to [Cells](/overviews/Cells.md). There are detailed and complete TL-B schemes for all objects in TON: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb.

## Scheme
Each TL-B scheme consists of declarations. Each declaration describes _constructor_ for some _type_. For instance _type_ Bool may have two _constructors_ for `true` and `false` values.


Typical TL-B declarations are shown below:
```
bool_false$0 = Bool;
bool_true$1 = Bool;

unary_zero$0 = Unary ~0;
unary_succ$1 {n:#} x:(Unary ~n) = Unary ~(n + 1);

acc_trans#5 account_addr:bits256
   transactions:(HashmapAug 64 ^Transaction CurrencyCollection)
   state_update:^(HASH_UPDATE Account)
   = AccountBlock;
```


Each TL-B declaration consist of:
* Constructor: _constructor name_ immediately followed by an optional _constructor tag_
* list of explicit and implicit field definitions are separated by whitespaces (`" "`, `"\n"`, etc)
* sign `=`
* (optionally parametrized) _Type name_

Example: two constructors (with different binary prefixes) for `Bool` type.
```
bool_false$0 = Bool;
bool_true$1 = Bool;
```

### Constructor
Constructor is declared via a `constructor_name[separator,tag]`.

A `constructor_name` consists of `[A-z0-9_]` symbols. snake_case names are conventionally used.

A constructor name can be followed by a `separator`. Absence of `separator` means that `tag` will be calculated automatically as 32bit  `crc32`-sum of constructor declarations. If `separator` is present, it can take two values `#` and `$`. The former means that a `tag` will be given in a hexadecimal form, the latter means a binary `tag`.
After both separators, an undercore symbol `_` may come standing for an empty tag.


There is also a special constructor_name `_` (called anonymous constructor) that means that there is only one unnamed constructor with empty tag for a given type.

The table below displays possible tag definitions.

| Constructor | tag |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  `_`     | empty tag for anonymous constructor     |
|  `some`     | automatically calculated 32-bit tag       |
|  `some#bba`     | 12-bit tag equal to `0b101110111010`      |
|  `some$01011`     | 5-bit tag equal to `0b01011`      |
|  `some#_`     | empty tag      |
|  `some$_`     | empty tag      |

Note that pregenerated tages are not usually used; explicitly declared are preferred.
### Field definitions
#### Explicit
Each field definition has the _ident : type-expr_, where _ident_ is an identifier with the name of the field (replaced by an underscore `_` for anonymous fields), and _type-expr_ is the field type. The type provided here is a type expression, which may include simple types or parametrized types with suitable parameters. Variables — i.e., the (identifiers of the) previously defined fields of types `#` (natural numbers) or `Type` (type of types) — may be used as parameters for the parametrized types.

There is a few predefined _types_:
* `#` - means unsigned 32-bit number
* `## N` - the same as `uintN` - means unsigned N-bit number
* `#<= N` - means a number between `0` and `N` (including both). Such number is stored in `ceil(log2(N+1))` bits.
* `N * Bit` - means N-bit slice
* `^Cell` - means arbitrary cell in reference
* `^[ field_definitions ]` - means that field definitions are stored in referenced cell
* `Type` - stands for arbitrary type (but only presents in implicit definitions).

_type-expr_ usually consist of (optionally parametrized) _Type_ only like: `last_trans_lt:uint64` or `_:StateInit`. However it is possilbe that _type-expr_ also contains conditions. In that case _type-expr_ consist of _ident_, `:`, _condition_, `?`, _type_. If condition (which can refer to previously defined fields) renders to `false` corresponding field is not presented. For instance `prev:n?^(ProofChain n)` means that `prev` field is only presented for objects when `n>0`.

#### Implicit
Some fields may be implicit. Their definitions are surrounded by curly braces, which indicate that the field is not actually present in the serialization, but that its value must be deduced from other data (usually the parameters of the type being serialized).
For instance 
```
nothing$0 {X:Type} = Maybe X;
just$1 {X:Type} value:X = Maybe X;
```

means the following: some other constructor may define field `var:(Maybe #)`. In that case, variable will be serialized either as `1` bit and serialization of `#` (uint32) if `var` is presents, or as `0` bit if `var` absents. That way `Maybe` is declared as C++-like _template_ type for arbitrary type X. However if `Maybe` would be declared as `nothing$0 {X:#} = Maybe X;`, that will mean that `Maybe` is declared for arbitrary number (not totally arbitrary type X).

### Type definition
Type name consist of `[A-z0-9_]` symbols. By convention it is CamelCase name.

It can be parametrized by one or more parameters.

Some occurrences of “variables” are prefixed by a tilde(`~`). That means that prior to deserialization the exact value of that variable is not known, but instead will be computed during deserialization.

Lets consider
```
unary_zero$0 = Unary ~0;
unary_succ$1 {n:#} x:(Unary ~n) = Unary ~(n + 1);
```

and the case when we want to deserialize `Unary ~N` object from the slice containing `0b1111111100101` bit string. When we say that we want to deserialize `Unary ~N` that means that we do not know yet whether we deserialize `Unary 0`, `Unary 7` or `Unary 1020`. Instead we start with `0b1111111100101` and compare it with constructor prefixes `0b0` for `unary_zero` and `0b1` for `unary_succ`. We see that we have `unary_succ`, but again the value of `N` can not be deducted, instead we should obtain it from deserialization of variable `x`. This variable has type `Unary ~(N-1)` and value of `N-1` can be deducted from deserialization of the rest bits in slice.
We get the rest bits of the slice and try to deserialize `Unary ~(N-1)` and again see `unary_succ` tag. That way we recursively dive into `Unary` until we get to the `Unary ~(N-8)`. At that level we see that rest of the slice starts from `unary_zero` tag and thus constitute `Unary 0` object. Popping back up we can get that initially we had `Unary 8` object.
So after deserialization of `Unary ~N` from Slice(`0b1111111100101`) we get `Unary 8` object and the rest Slice(`0b0101`) from which subsequent variables of the constructor can be deserialized.

### Constraints
Some implicit fields may contain constraints, for instance `{n <= m}`. It means that previously defined variables n and m should satisfy corresponding the inequality. This inequality is inherent property of the constructor. It should be checked during serialization, besides objects with variables which not satisfy constraints are invalid.

Example of constructors with constraints:
```
hml_short$0 {m:#} {n:#} len:(Unary ~n) {n <= m} s:(n * Bit) = HmLabel ~n m;
hml_long$10 {m:#} n:(#<= m) s:(n * Bit) = HmLabel ~n m;
hml_same$11 {m:#} v:Bit n:(#<= m) = HmLabel ~n m;
```

## Comments
TL-B schemas support C-like comments:
```
/* 
This is a
multiline
comment 
*/

// This is one line comment
```


## (De)serialization
Given the TL-B scheme any object can be serialized to builder and deserialized from slice.
In particular, when we deserialize object we need to start with determination of corresponding constructor by tag and then deserialize variables one by one from left to right (recursively jumping to serialization of variable which are TL-B objects themselves).
During serialization we going the other way, by finding and writing to the builder `tag` which corresponds to given object of the type and then continue from left to write with each variable.

For parsers, It is recommended to read scheme once and generate serializator and deserializator for each type, instead of referring to the scheme on the fly.

TL-B is also supported by [intellij-ton plugin](https://github.com/andreypfau/intellij-ton).
