[2025-03-19T10:43:49] **Anton Trunov**: üéâ Tact v1.6.3 and v1.6.4 are released!

We're back with some quality-of-life improvements! I cannot promise there won't be another patch release before the next big one ‚Äî that's because we're working on something really enticing in the background and would like you to continue receiving updates in the meantime.

Now, this isn't a dual release per se. It's just that the post for v1.6.3 got lost in the river of time... Kidding! The two patches are simply very connected since we wanted to ensure that v1.6.4 acknowledges the possible gaps in v1.6.3.

Let's unfold the v1.6.3 and v1.6.4 at once:

üõ† Bug fixes

‚Ä¢ In the compilation report, TL-B for Address? is not Maybe Address, but plain Address. This is a temporary measure until the Address type is reworked to allow not just the addr_std scheme, but also the addr_none, addr_var and addr_extern.

‚Ä¢ Parameter reordering optimization is now only applied to single-parameter asm extension functions, to avoid confusion when performing multiple mutation operations on arguments.

‚Ä¢ The postinstall script has been removed from Tact's package.json so that Node.js package managers won't unexpectedly trip on it when you try to upgrade or reinstall the compiler in your projects.

‚úçÔ∏è Documentation updates

‚Ä¢ Deprecated Deployable and FactoryDeployable traits in favor of null message body receive(), with or without a call to the new cashback() function at your discretion.

‚Ä¢ ‚õΩÔ∏è Added gas best practices page, go check it out to reduce gas usage of your contracts: Gas best practices.

‚Ä¢ üéÅ Enhanced the TypeScript wrappers produced by Tact compiler, and documented how to use the new exit code and opcode records: Interacting with TypeScript wrappers.

‚Ä¢ Added missing reference docs and fixed many descriptions and links throughout the standard library.

‚Ä¢ Made a significant change to the Reference section: removed the core-common and core-advanced pages, and distributed their contents across other libraries, such as: core-crypto, core-contextstate, core-send, core-gas, and core-addresses.

üß≥ Miscellaneous improvements

‚Ä¢ Added forceBasechain() and forceWorkchain() functions.

‚Ä¢ Added the internalExternalReceiversOutsideMethodsMap config option as part of optimization options to prevent the contracts from being incorrectly recognized by some explorers and user wallets.

‚Ä¢ Further decreased gas usage of contracts with some special cases of binary and fallback Slice receivers. This is relevant mainly for Jettons, but other contracts could benefit from this, too.

‚Ä¢ The old parser is finally removed. As a user of the compiler, you shouldn't notice a thing, but if something misparses or behaves weirdly in terms of syntax ‚Äî please notify us in the chat or by opening an issue and providing a minimal reproducible example.

[2025-03-18T12:41:35] **Anton Trunov**: As Maksim said, you can explicitly specify the message opcode, but if you need to access the opcode in your code, you can add a constant like this:


const TakeWalletAddressOpcode: Int = 0xd1735400;

message(TakeWalletAddressOpcode) TakeWalletAddress {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    walletAddress: Address;
    ownerAddress: Cell?; //It is Maybe ^Address, just encoded it like this
}


There is a task to add static fields for message opcodes: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/2230, so you will be able to do it in a simpler way: TakeWalletAddress.opcode  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [57009](https://t.me/tactlang/57009)) [#57014](https://t.me/tactlang/57014)
[2025-03-18T12:33:37] **maksim**: Yes, our router does exactly this (parsing incoming message OP) to determine what receiver should accept the message, but we can't use this in case of a few possible payloads. I mean in one receiver, if it's suits your use-case, you can define exact structure of full message, for example:

message(0x7362d09c) JettonNotification {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as coins;
    sender: Address;
    forwardPayload: Int as uint256; // uint instead of remaining if you only want to accept this exact payload
}

But if you want to have a few of this, you will have to write separate receivers for them. Not perfect but somewhat similar example is Tact v5 wallet contract compatible with func, check patterns used there (you might need to check v5 tlb to get a grip)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [57009](https://t.me/tactlang/57009)) [#57011](https://t.me/tactlang/57011)
[2025-03-18T12:17:04] **Gosha Kapelyushok**: Thanks, that helped! I'm curious, how does the message receiver in Tact determine what kind of message has arrived? I assume the op code is already "added" there, so maybe it's possible to extract it from the transferred message without adding a new tag field?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [57008](https://t.me/tactlang/57008)) [#57009](https://t.me/tactlang/57009)
[2025-03-18T11:14:25] **maksim**: In case like this (with jetton transfer notification), you can define receiver as in this, and then use forwardPayload Slice type field to parse it manually. If you are certain in what type you are expecting, you can use Struct.fromSlice, but yeah, it only supports predefined structs at the moment

If you have limited number of possible incoming payloads, you could do something like tagging yourself, like make first 32 bytes define struct type, for example

struct FirstPossiblePayload {
 tag: Int as uint32, // e.g tag is 0x1 for this
 ... your fields
}

message(0x7362d09c) JettonNotification {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as coins;
    sender: Address;
    forwardPayload: Slice as remaining;
}

struct SecondPossiblePayload {
 tag: Int as uint32, // e.g tag is 0x2 for this
 ... your fields
}

// in receiver code

let payload = msg.forwardPayload
let tag = payload.loadUint(32)

if (tag == 0x1) {
 // parse with Struct.fromSlice
}
// same with other cases  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [57007](https://t.me/tactlang/57007)) [#57008](https://t.me/tactlang/57008)
[2025-03-18T10:49:40] **Gosha Kapelyushok**: Thx, But I was thinking more about how this code would look on Tact, where the payload contains the transferred message.

[2025-03-17T16:31:13] **Gosha Kapelyushok**: Hello! Can anyone help me with parsing a payload? Is there an elegant way to parse a payload into a message or a struct?

For example, my payload is a Slice where I store either:
struct A { a: Int }
struct B { b: Address }
How can I determine which struct it is when receiving this payload?

I found Struct.fromSlice in the documentation, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to support pattern matching based on the struct type  [#56948](https://t.me/tactlang/56948)

By the way, to send excesses back on deployment, instead of the empty receive(){}, starting with Tact 1.6.1 you could have receve(){ cashback(sender()) }  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [56449](https://t.me/tactlang/56449)) [#56450](https://t.me/tactlang/56450)

send(SendParameters{

Just make sure that the contract has enough funds for this, or you'll get exit code 37 in the action phase: Not enough Toncoin  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [56423](https://t.me/tactlang/56423)) [#56429](https://t.me/tactlang/56429)

[2025-03-09T02:44:22] **–ØÃ®kov**: That's a thing of the past. Although we still compile to FunC, we now employ a wide range of optimizations which are tough and cumbersome to do when programming in FunC directly.

It has lots of distinct features and it's also safe ‚Äî we've passed a thorough security audit by Trail of Bits last autumn.

Tact has comprehensive documentation, ever-expanding collection of great tooling and long-lasting plans for the future.

[2025-03-07T13:07:17] **Anton Trunov**: üéâ Tact v1.6.2 is released!

Release a day keeps the sanitarians away. 

Seriously though, before we commit to the next big release, refining rough edges and adding useful things to the standard library is always nice without making you wait for them for long. To discover such points of improvement, we actively collect feedback that we see in Tact chats and that we receive from the teams that actively use Tact in production.

We're not yet done with all the suggestions, so apart from this release, there are plans to make at least one more patch release with possible bug fixes and additions to the standard library.

‚ù§Ô∏è All constructive feedback is welcome ‚Äî let's enjoy writing ‚ö°Ô∏è Tact together!

On that note, let's quickly unpack the v1.6.2:

üõ† Bug fixes

‚Ä¢ An empty init() function is no longer implicitly added when empty contract parameters are declared. This is done to save gas and storage, and it is backward compatible with the lazy initialization that Tact offered as the sole data initialization mechanism before v1.6.0.

‚Ä¢ Compiler no longer screams at you if the message struct becomes small enough to fit into the 224 bits and does not require an explicit bounced<M> constructor. That was a noisy warning, and it's much better without it.

‚Ä¢ Contract constructors are now public in TypeScript wrappers.

‚Ä¢ Now, if getters do not have explicit method ID overrides in Tact code, they are called by their name and not their numeric IDs in the generated TypeScript wrappers. This change restores the pre-1.6.0 behavior that was important for compatibility with some third-party tools that do not support calling getters by their method IDs.

‚Ä¢ Compiler upgrades via npm i now work as they should. Note that upgrades through the npm update --save command continue working, too.

üß∞ Standard library additions and changes

‚Ä¢ Doc comments, doc comments everywhere! They're especially fun to use with the language server, see more info on that below.

‚Ä¢ Added Slice.skipRef, Slice.skipMaybeRef, Slice.skipBool, Slice.skipCoins, Slice.skipVarUint16, Slice.skipVarInt16, Slice.skipVarUint32, Slice.skipVarInt32, Slice.skipAddress functions.

üìú See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.2
üì• And upgrade Tact in your projects

The alpha testing for the new TON Studio's official Tact language server continues. Have you tried it? It also has a neat VSCode extension and an extension for VSCode-based editors!

Here's a quick rundown of their features:
‚Ä¢ Semantic syntax highlighting
‚Ä¢ Code completion with auto import, postfix completion, snippets, and import completion
‚Ä¢ Go to definition, implementation, type definition
‚Ä¢ Find all references, workspace symbol search, symbol renaming
‚Ä¢ Types and documentation on hover
‚Ä¢ Inlay hints for types, parameter names, and more
‚Ä¢ On-the-fly inspections with quick fixes
‚Ä¢ Signature help inside calls, and actions for initOf and struct initialization
‚Ä¢ Lenses with implementation/reference counts
‚Ä¢ Gas estimates for assembly functions
‚Ä¢ Commands for building and testing projects based on Blueprint and tact-template
‚Ä¢ Integration with Tact compiler and Misti static analyzer

Sounds exciting? Install it and tell us what needs improvement ‚Äî the language server is quite new, but it matures very fast!

üç≤ please try to enjoy each release equally

[2025-03-05T21:55:24] **Setmax**: Hey guys, I used the upgrade mechanism, added two new get methods and a counter variable to the initial contract, built it, and then used contract.code.boc in upgrade.ts:


            const newCodePath = './build/contract.code.boc';
            const newCodeBoc = fs.readFileSync(newCodePath);
            const newCodeCell = Cell.fromBoc(newCodeBoc)[0];

            // Send the upgrade message
            console.log('Sending upgrade message...');
            await MyContract.send(
                provider.sender(),
                {
                    value: toNano('0.05'),
                },
                {
                    $$type: 'Upgrade',
                    code: newCodeCell,
                    data: null
                }
            );


Now, it seems that none of the methods, including getVersion, are callable, and I keep getting the ‚ÄòGot exit_code: 9‚Äô error.

But i keep getting failed transaction with error "Insufficient amount"
Note that the contract has 0.81 TON and 0.05 USDT (meaning the contract has enough money to do the transaction)

[2025-03-05T01:26:40] **Daniil Sedov**: You‚Äôre calculating the signature wrong. You should not convert it to BoC but just take a hash of it and sign this hash. Then in smart contract you also take the signed cell‚Äôs hash to verify it.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [55771](https://t.me/tactlang/55771)) [#55853](https://t.me/tactlang/55853)

I'm writing an Airdrop contract in Tact where I have used signature-based airdrop minting on TON:



üîπ Off-Chain: Signature Generation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Cell storing:

User‚Äôs address (storeAddress)
Reward amount (storeInt with 256 bits)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert the Cell to bytes (toBoc()).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Sign the bytes using Ed25519 with the private key.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Save the signature, user address, and reward in signedAirdropData.json.


üîπ On-Chain: Signature Verification
1Ô∏è‚É£ The contract receives:

User address
Reward amount
Signature (as a Slice)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Recreates the same Cell with:
Provided user address

[2025-03-02T03:57:27] **Amir Rafati**: The Problem

I deployed the contract on the TON testnet and tried sending a SelectPixels transaction with bigPixel = 2. However, the transaction failed with an error. Here‚Äôs the transaction log:


Timestamp: Mar 2, 2025, 03:14:08 AM
Hash: a03289db8f0d117c4e562cc6a3786084b90d51b7134cc5830b1de5a0e92e7f1e

From: 0QBqTfI7lR3GhBY3TCiruGaFdlvsbms9xQ8y4TvmXvhJxa-u
To: kQAjskv9ZlomJHwzs4KrEWyluFizhIQTgRlrXnenjznRmdOp

TON Amount: 0.01 TON
Op Code: 0x15952fac

Status: Error
Success: False


I suspect the issue is related to the bigPixel value or how it‚Äôs processed in the contract. With eachSelected = 2, minValue = 1_000_000, and maxValue = 2_000_000, the contract expects bigPixel to be a 6-digit number (e.g., 1_234_567). Sending bigPixel = 2 fails the requirement msg.bigPixel >= self.gameConfig.minValue, which could explain the error.

Questions for Help

Fixing the Input Value:
Should I modify the client code to send a valid bigPixel (e.g., 1_234_567)? What‚Äôs a good test value for eachSelected = 2 and totalGamePixels = 9?
Or should I adjust the contract‚Äôs minValue and maxValue to accept smaller numbers like 2?



Improving SelectPixels Logic:
The current logic extracts 3-digit numbers from bigPixel and checks them against conditions. How could I simplify this or make it more flexible (e.g., support variable digit lengths)?

Any suggestions to handle edge cases better (e.g., when no valid pixels are selected)?



Debugging the Error:
How can I get more detailed error info from the testnet to confirm why it failed? Is there a way to log revert reasons in TON?



General Enhancements:
Any other improvements you‚Äôd recommend for the SelectPixels functionality or the contract overall?  [#55620](https://t.me/tactlang/55620)

[2025-03-02T03:56:54] **Amir Rafati**: Hi everyone,


I‚Äôm working on a TON smart contract called PixelSelection and need some help modifying the SelectPixels message handling code. I‚Äôve included the relevant contract and client code below, along with details of an error I encountered. I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights on how to fix this and improve the functionality!

Overview of the Current Code

The PixelSelection contract allows users to select pixels by sending a SelectPixels message with a bigPixel value. The contract then extracts up to eachSelected (set between 2 and 25) 3-digit numbers from bigPixel and processes them as pixel selections if they meet certain conditions (e.g., not already selected, within bounds, etc.). Here's the key part of the contract:  [#55616](https://t.me/tactlang/55616)
[2025-03-01T17:22:26] **–ØÃ®kov**: Should be. There's no "system" cell anymore ‚Äî Tact no longer stores the parent contract code in the system cell with all the child contract codes used in initOf expression. Instead, the myCode function and related instruction are used.

However, if your logic is too complex to lay out flat (some recursive dependencies), then there would be a system-like cell. But in that case, upgrades would be very hard even if it wasn't there :)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [55592](https://t.me/tactlang/55592)) [#55593](https://t.me/tactlang/55593)
[2025-03-01T17:20:46] **Andrey Vladimirovich**: Does it work correctly? The last time I used this method, it broke address calculations with child contracts.

[2025-03-01T15:46:27] **Anton Trunov**: Tact now provides some out-of-the-box optimizations that people can also replicate in FunC with some magic Fift techniques. Most optimizations are in the code generator but some requires some planning from the smart contracts dev, for instance, using the new features and stdlib functions like
- contract parameters  
- Basechain Addresses
- deploy and message functions instead of send

We are working on a new page in the Tact docs which provides some guidelines on how to do gas optimizations in your Tact contracts. Will be published next week, stay tuned :)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [55577](https://t.me/tactlang/55577)) [#55578](https://t.me/tactlang/55578)

[2025-03-01T09:05:57] **Anton Trunov**: üéâ Tact v1.6.0 is released!

üèÜ This is the biggest update of Tact since its creation, bigger than all previous milestones combined. There were so many improvements that we've even won over FunC in terms of gas usage on many standard contracts, such as Jettons.
ü§î Don't believe me?
ü•≥ Let's unpack Tact v1.6.0 together and see these improvements for ourselves!

We'll start with the number one achievement of this release:

‚õΩÔ∏è Gas optimization victory over FunC

Gas has long been a major pain point for Tact. Prior to v1.6.0, Tact's gas usage on many common contracts, such as Jettons, was far from ideal, requiring about 2.5 times gas of the FunC reference implementation.

But with Tact 1.6.0, those old gas-expensive days are long gone.

ü§Ø For example, a Tact rewrite of the reference FunC Jetton code consumes less gas for transfer, burn and discovery messages!
üòé So, expect to receive easy-to-use idiomatic Tact implementations of common contracts in the near future

Some of the things we did to achieve this:
‚ñ™Ô∏è Removed "system" cell ‚Äî parent contract code is no longer stored in the system cell with all the child contract codes
‚ñ™Ô∏è Removed redundant address checks
‚ñ™Ô∏è Deprecated Deployable trait in favor of receive(){}
‚ñ™Ô∏è Introduced contract parameters as an alternative to init() function

And optimized compiler internals, many old and new functions in the stdlib:

üß∞ Some of the standard library additions and changes

‚Ä¢ Added specialized deploy and message functions for efficient on-chain deployments and non-deployment messages respectively
‚Ä¢ Many math functions, such as divc, mulShiftRightCeil, and others
‚Ä¢ More advanced functions, such as setGasLimit, setSeed, myCode, and others
‚Ä¢ Handy throwIf and throwUnless functions, which deprecated their "native" prefixed counterparts
‚Ä¢ Optimized emptyCell and emptySlice functions
‚Ä¢ Int.toString function now consumes up to 64% less gas
‚Ä¢ Int.toFloatString function now consumes up to 62% less gas

Added many functions for Cell, Slice and Builder types:
‚Ä¢  Variable integer serialization types and the corresponding .load and .store functions of Slice and Builder types
‚Ä¢ Functions Slice.hashData and String.hashData for efficient hashes of data only
‚Ä¢ Functions for working with addresses: Slice.asAddress, Slice.asAddressUnsafe, contractHash, and a new BasechainAddress type its helper functions
‚Ä¢ ...and more!

üß≥ More auxiliary things

‚Ä¢ Basic let-destructuring of structs and Messages
‚Ä¢ Compile-time method ID expressions for getters and Message opcodes
‚Ä¢ The codeOf expression to get the code of child contracts
‚Ä¢ More map improvements and new methods, like replace and replaceGet
‚Ä¢ New augmented assignment operators &&=, ||=, >>= and <<=
‚Ä¢ Better error reporting for many cases
‚Ä¢ Generation of constants in TypeScript wrappers
‚Ä¢ The -w, --watch CLI flags for watching for changes and automatic recompilations
‚Ä¢ CLI for the Tact's TVM disassembler ‚Äî unboc
‚Ä¢ Fixes of the compilation report
‚Ä¢ Fixes of the compiler's third-party API
‚Ä¢ Fixes of the internal infrastructure and code generation
‚Ä¢ Lots of other miscellaneous bug fixes and smaller enhancements
‚Ä¢ ...and documentation for all of that and beyond!

Besides, check out the updated Awesome Tact list and add your awesome projects, especially those using Tact in production!

‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes

There are only two, and they're both pretty minor:

‚Ä¢ Tact 1.6.0 replaces Context.bounced field with Context.bounceable, which tells whether the received message can bounce back or not. Previously, the bounced was useless since any bounced messages would be handled in a separate bounced() receiver.

‚Ä¢ The enabledMasterchain option was removed from tact.config.json. Going forward, support of masterchain addresses is always enabled in Tact contracts.

‚ô•Ô∏è Special thanks goes to all the contributors and community members ‚Äî without you there would be nothing. Let's keep building the future of smart contracts with ‚ö°Ô∏è Tact!

[2025-02-27T17:57:55] **Hung**: Hello, I just started developing yesterday, so I have a very beginner-level question.

I can't access the .ton domain network. I carefully read the documentation stating that a specific proxy must be used as a "secret gateway," and I have tried everything‚Äîfrom the proxy provided by Ton Wallet to the connector.exe available on GitHub. However, I still can't connect.

Could it be that my country (or region) is banned?

When I use a proxy and fail to connect in Chrome, I get error codes like ERR_TIMEOUT and ERR_PROXY. When I disable the proxy and fail, I receive a DNS ERROR code.  [#55382](https://t.me/tactlang/55382)

[2025-02-24T17:09:29] **Vsevolod Ignatyev**: In general ‚Äî yes, because ParentContract is available for the next transaction after sending message to the ChildContract, however you can build the architecture of the smart-contract in a way, that User2 would not be able to modify the state variable in ParentContract before the first chain completes. For example you can implement a counter state variable that's state is updated once the whole chain of transactions is executed (the message from ChildContract came back to ParentContract)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [55126](https://t.me/tactlang/55126)) [#55153](https://t.me/tactlang/55153)

[2025-02-24T01:48:23] **Ivan**: Hi everyone! Quick question, just to be sure:

Am I understanding correctly: During a chain of calls where User1 triggers ParentContract -> ChildContract -> back to ParentContract, can User2 modify the state variable in ParentContract before the first chain completes?

Context:
- User1 sets variable to 1 in Parent
- Parent sends 1 to Child
- Child sends 1 back to Parent
- Parent checks if (variable == received)  [#55126](https://t.me/tactlang/55126)

[2025-02-23T11:41:59] **–ØÃ®kov**: The code is compiled to the .boc format, and the data is simply the starting (or initial, hence "init") values for variables in the persistent state of the contract.

https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#boc

Combination of initial code and data is used to obtain the address of the future contract, to where you send the deployment message with said code & data.

I have a question about the jetton internal transfer
myJettonWwalletInit: StateInit;

receive(msg: Transfer) {
   let qid = self.currentWithdrawCounter;
   self.currentWithdrawCounter = qid + 1;

   send(SendParameters{
      to: contractAddress(self.myJettonWalletInit),
      value: ton("0.05"),
      bounce: false,
      mode: SendRemainingValue,
      body: TokenTransfer{
         queryId: qid,
         amount: msg.amount,
         destination: msg.receiver,
         response_destination: msg.receiver,
         custom_payload: null,
         forward_ton_amount: ton("0.01"),
         forward_payload: emptySlice(),
      }.toCell(),
      code: self.myJettonWalletInit.code,
      data: self.myJettonWalletInit.data,
   });
}
I create 2 contracts, 1 is jetton token and 1 is function contract, I try to send this receive function, but keep getting actionResultCode: 37(no enough ton or jetton?), I changed the value and forward_ton_amount to higher ton, still display same error.

In the transaction, the transaction process only reached Jetton Transfer, won't go to the next Jetton Internal Transfer and Jetton Notify.

[2025-02-18T22:14:40] **Rob**: Hi guys. I have a very simple counter contract:
import "@stdlib/deploy";

contract Counter with Deployable {
    val: Int as uint32;
    queryId: Int as uint32;

    init(queryNumber: Int) {
        self.val = 0;
        self.queryId = queryNumber;
    }

    receive("increment") {
        self.val += 1;
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.val;
    }
}
My question is that how to send a transaction with increment message to the contract using @tonconnect/ui package in Javascript? I have already written the following code. But it shows me fee calculation error. I think there is a problem with encoding payload:
const incrementCounter = async () => {
        if (!connectedWallet) return;
        try {
            const payload = btoa("increment"); // Encode "increment" message in Base64

            const transaction = {
                validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60,
                messages: [
                    {
                        address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
                        amount: "100000000", // Small amount of TON for execution
                        payload, // Encoded message
                    },
                ],
            };

            await tonConnectUI?.sendTransaction(transaction);
            fetchCounter(); // Refresh counter after transaction
        } catch (error) {

I'm getting a "can't decode address transactions" error from the /v2/jettons/transactions endpoint.

Problem:
GET request to:
https://tonapi.io/v2/jettons/transactions?jetton_address={JETTON_CONTRACT_ADDRESS}&account={WALLET_ADDRESS}

Returns:
```json
{
    "error": "can't decode address transactions"
}
Context:
Trying to get Jetton payment records for a wallet. Using Jetton contract & wallet addresses as parameters.

Tried:

User-Friendly & Raw formats for WALLET_ADDRESS.
Verified JETTON_CONTRACT_ADDRESS format.
Addresses valid on explorers.
Reviewed API docs, no error info.
Questions:

Is /v2/jettons/transactions the right endpoint for wallet payment records? If not, which one is?
Correct formats for WALLET_ADDRESS & JETTON_CONTRACT_ADDRESS? Raw WALLET_ADDRESS mandatory?
Why "can't decode address transactions" error? Address format issue? API issue?
Any help appreciated!
I would be very grateful for any help or suggestions to resolve this issue. Thank you in advance for your assistance!  [#54538](https://t.me/tactlang/54538)

When I set a valid value for amount inside transaction, Tonkeeper opens the invoice successfully.
However, the invoice displays 0 USDT instead of the correct amount.
When clicking "Confirm Payment", no amount is deducted from the wallet except for network fees, meaning that the actual value is not included in the transaction.

Passing amount: "0" ‚Üí Received the error Invalid amount: 0.
Removing amount from transaction completely ‚Üí Received the error No value for amount.
Passing amount: amountInNanoJettons.toString() ‚Üí But Tonkeeper still does not display the correct amount in the invoice.

I need to store a group of numbers, and it can potentially be very large. Numbers are added via a message from another contract. At a certain point, I need to recalculate these numbers in a loop.

What's the best way to store them? Currently, I'm using a map, but when the number of elements exceeds 300-400, I hit the gas limit. Could serialization be a solution? Or should I manually pack them into storage slots? How can I make this as gas-efficient as possible?  [#53624](https://t.me/tactlang/53624)

[2025-01-24T17:20:14] **Adam Ton**: üöÄ Staking Made Scalable! ü™ô

Hey everyone! üëã

Here‚Äôs a small idea for a staking contract using the Jetton principle it took me some time to apply .
Here are the keyfeatures:

Scalability: Each Jetton wallet tracks its own staking data, solving the problem of storing infinite dividend history. üìä
How it works: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stake TON ‚Üí Master contract mints staked Jettons and keep the staked ton.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Withdraw ‚Üí Burn Jettons, get TON back and get data from your jetton wallet to calculate reward . 
Simple, efficient, and perfect for scaling! Let me know your thoughts! 
Check my git so you can read the contract: 

https://github.com/Vodka2134156/staked-TON/ 

Thanks for motivations
 Note :In my contract I stored just date of staking you can store more data of staking
and the contract is detected as token so people will be more familiar with it  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [52718](https://t.me/tactlang/52718)) [#52732](https://t.me/tactlang/52732)

Contract 1 is the main contract that records total data, similar to the main contract of a jetton. Contract 2 is a user-specific contract used to record the user's exclusive data, like a sub-contract of a jetton. The user sends a staking message to Contract 1, which deploys Contract 2 for the user and confirms whether the user has already staked. If the user has already staked, it does not allow the user to stake again and refunds the amount.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [52467](https://t.me/tactlang/52467)) [#52468](https://t.me/tactlang/52468)

[2025-01-19T20:25:17] **Ivan**: Hey everyone! 

Need help with jetton deposits implementation. Here's my setup:

- Game contract deploys jetton master contract, mints tokens and transfers them to game's wallet (to ensure tokens are only accessible through gameplay)
- Initially players can participate by paying only gas fees and earn tokens through gameplay
- After initial phase ends(maybe 2 or 3 months), players need to deposit tokens to participate
- Each player has a Child contract tracking their balance
- Using standard jetton implementation in Tact

What's working:
- Token transfers FROM game contract to players
- Child contracts tracking balances
- Initial free participation phase

The core issue: How to detect when players send tokens back to the game's wallet? Need to know:
1. When tokens arrive and who sent them
2. The exact amount received

The balance update logic is ready - just need help with detecting incoming jetton transfers.

Thanks! üôè  [#52122](https://t.me/tactlang/52122)

[2025-01-18T23:14:53] **Zewa üßª Expert**: Hey!
I'm a bit confused while working with maps.
@ton/core

let cell = slice.loadRef();
let map = Dictionary.loadDirect(Dictionary.Keys.Int(32), Dictionary.Values.Cell(), cell.beginParse())

And it works with the map I have.

But with tact 

struct MapStruct {
    m: map<Int as int32, Cell>;
}
...
let cell = slice.loadRef();
let map = MapStruct.fromCell(cell)


I'm getting exitCode: 9.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong? üôÇ
Are there way to loadDict without temp Struct?

I've also tried to call func load_dict with ext function and seems like there are no errors while parsing:

(slice, cell) load_dict(slice s) asm( -> 1 0) "LDDICT";
...
@name(load_dict)
extends mutates native loadDict(self: Slice): Cell;

let mapCell = cell.beginParse().loadDict();

Did you know, that there's a tact-template that comes pre-configured to kickstart your new Tact projects?

It is much slimmer than the Blueprint-based projects, and focused only on Tact: it includes the compiler, Sandbox-based Jest tests, and basic scripts and utils to get you started in no time!

ü™Ñ And now, with the help of a community contributor, it also has neat system prompts designed specifically for AI-focused editors like Cursor and Windsurf. Utilize them to gain an edge over competition and aid yourself with prototyping smart contracts.

[2025-01-13T13:09:47] **–°–µ–º–µ–Ω**: If you want to calculate Tact contract address via init code + init data you need to add system cell to init parameters 
afaik tact implicitly add additional parameters to init data (contract constructor)

Recently I came across with it and solved like this (link)
In short init data will be something similar to this:

let init = beginCell()
// Implicit Tact init data
.storeRef(SYSTEM_CELL)
.storeUint(0, 1)
// Jetton wallet init data
.storeAddress(master)
.storeAddress(owner)
.endCell()

    jettonMasterAddress: Address;
}

// And the function to calculate the wallet address may look like this:

    let initData = JettonWalletData{

    return contractAddress(StateInit{

[2025-01-12T08:03:24] **Anton Trunov**: @braglop the working language in this chat is English and the chat is moderated strictly to make it a useful place for all devs of any origin, so I removed your discussion in Russian. 

To answer some of your concerns:
- there are production contracts written in Tact, for instance GasPump. The language is growing in terms of adoption: a lot of contracts on verifier.ton.org are implemented in Tact;
- you can check the WIP Jetton implementation written in Tact here: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton. It is WIP because we want to implement a few features based on modern TVM instructions. We are using this contract as a benchmark to improve gas consumption of Tact contracts, some of those are already implemented and will be released in Tact 1.6, you can check the results in the table here: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton/wiki#gas-benchmark-results
- TON Studio is building many useful Tact contract templates, like Jettons, NFTs, simple DEXes, for devs to make it easier to build on TON with Tact  [#51453](https://t.me/tactlang/51453)

That is, for example, my bot is written in Python and some transactions have a suspicious sign. However, if I write Here in JavaScript, this sign disappears. Can this really make sense, or is it still a matter of the operation and organization of the transactions themselves in the Tact Fan–° language.. and the choice of programming language for the Bot does not matter?

[2025-01-09T11:28:25] **Anton Trunov**: for instance, now the contract storage has the ‚Äúlazy loading‚Äù bit at the beginning and the dictionary of the code cells of the child contracts, but this is a subject to change in the next version, since it is more gas efficient and we are currently implementing a series of gas optimizations  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [51111](https://t.me/tactlang/51111)) [#51112](https://t.me/tactlang/51112)

or if it‚Äôs not specified, the Tact compiler computes it using the textual representation of the message declaration like so: name + "{" + fields.join(",") + ‚Äú}‚Äù, then it‚Äôs hashed with sha256 and and only the first 32 bits of the hash are taken.

You can also get that computed value from the compilation report Tact produces (look for a .md file in the build folder).  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [51093](https://t.me/tactlang/51093)) [#51095](https://t.me/tactlang/51095)

[2025-01-07T16:50:17] **Nerses**: How can storage optimization be approached in TON compared to EVM? In EVM, storage is structured slot by slot (32 bytes), making it efficient to organize data types like bytes32, bytes20, and bytes10 sequentially (e.g., bytes32, bytes20, bytes10 instead of bytes20, bytes32, bytes10).

[2025-01-07T15:43:38] **Ali**: Hey everyone!

On the EVM side, transactions can theoretically be reversed. Therefore, when building structures that include central systems such as bridges or CEX, we wait for Transaction Finality for the relevant transaction and if there are enough approvals, we record the relevant transaction in the backend.

Is TON Blockchain has kinda same think? How do we understand that the transaction is confirmed and cannot be reversed?  [#50867](https://t.me/tactlang/50867)

I tested the transfer functionality, and everything worked before. However, now users cannot send tokens to each other. As I understand, this is due to forwardTonAmount() that Tonkeeper sets to 1 by default. When I test the script without forwardTonAmount, the transaction goes through, but with this value, an error occurs. What should I do?  [#49148](https://t.me/tactlang/49148)

[2024-12-25T11:01:51] **Anton Trunov**: üéÑ Merry Christmas, Folks!

As we wrap up 2024, it's time to celebrate all that we've accomplished together.

üöÄ Adoption, Features and Tooling

Your biggest achievement this year was getting GitHub to support Tact on the entire website! We say you, because it wouldn't have been possible without you writing contracts, finding and reporting bugs & suggestions, and supporting Tact elsewhere ‚ù§Ô∏è

Regarding features and compiler updates, there were so many, that Tact has practically been reborn into a fresh, secure, easy and accessible language language for complex smart contracts, quick onboarding and fast prototyping.

In terms of tools, an awesome static analyzer Misti raised from 0 to hero: with over 25 issue detectors, CI/CD and Blueprint integrations. Additionally, the tree-sitter-tact and many editor packages and highlighting plugins were frequently updated to keep up with compiler updates.

üìö Documentation

Working on the clearest and most comprehensive documentation, we often had to dig deep into TON sources and discover what was really going on under the hood. And it was and is very worth it: the exit codes and assembly functions pages are the most vivid proofs.

We try to cater to both the experienced professionals and beginners on TON Blockchain, which is why you can expect more in-depth research of TVM, more production-ready examples of common contracts in Tact, and an even more streamlined onboarding experience ‚úàÔ∏è

üêû Bugfixes

The release 1.4.1 in particular squashed so many bugs, that the security audit of 1.5.0 went silky smooth ‚Äî no critical vulnerabilities found, as announced on TON Gateway.

As for the next release, we're fixing the internal representation of Address type, reworking the type system to support more TVM types with the most safety and convenience, and making rapid strides to reduce the gas consumption üõ†

üéÅ A Small Holiday Request

Finally, we have a small holiday wish: If you‚Äôve enjoyed our progress this year, consider gifting us a GitHub star. It‚Äôs a simple gesture, but one that means the world to us. Your support helps Tact grow and reach even greater heights.

üéÖ Happy holidays from the Tact team!
‚ù§Ô∏è Take care, get some well-deserved rest and prepare for 2025 ‚Äî we've got big plans for the next year

üç≤ sparkling future ahead

[2024-12-24T17:47:53] **Anton Trunov**: for instance, HASHEXT_SHA256 might be a better approach here (if the choice of a hash function is not important): it works on builders too and costs 1/33 gas units per byte  [#48777](https://t.me/tactlang/48777)

extends fun storeUint(self: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;


it does not have mutates keyword so it just returns a new modified builder, it does not modify its self argument in-place

you need to change your function as follows:


fun calculateExternalId(nonce: Int): Int {
    let b: Builder = beginCell();
    b = b.storeUint(nonce, 64);

[2024-12-17T17:50:35] **Ivan**: Hey folks! üëã
I'm working with a TactCounter smart contract (code below), and I need some help crafting a working example to call the MyAdd method using sendTransaction via TON Connect.

The contract looks like this:


import "@stdlib/deploy";

message MyAdd {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

contract TactCounter with Deployable {
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;

    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
    }

    receive(msg: MyAdd) {
        self.counter += msg.amount;
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}

Here's an example of a basic transaction with a comment:

const body = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 32)
  .storeStringTail("Hello, TON!")
  .endCell();

await connector.sendTransaction({
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 360,
  messages: [
    {
      address: destination,
      amount: toNano("0.05").toString(),
      payload: body.toBoc().toString("base64")
    }
  ]
});

I need to adapt this approach to send the MyAdd message, filling in queryId and amount fields properly. Can anyone help with the payload construction? üôè

[2024-12-16T15:13:07] **I≈ô≈ô√∏ƒè·∫Ωr**: I have 2 questions. 

Context: 

Tact_code
import { beginCell, Cell, contractAddress, StateInit, storeStateInit } from '@ton/core';

const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI();

const init = {
    code: Cell.fromBase64('<CONTRACT_CODE>'),
    data: Cell.fromBase64('<CONTRACT_INIT_DATA>')
} satisfies StateInit;

const stateInit = beginCell()
    .store(storeStateInit(init))
    .endCell();

const address = contractAddress(0, init);

await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({
    validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    messages: [
        {
            address: address.toRawString(),
            amount: '5000000',
            stateInit: stateInit.toBoc().toString('base64')
        }
    ]
});

This code is the standard for the deployment of a contract via a tonconnect. 

1 question - what should I put in contract_code? I have an import of @stdlib/deploy in my code. Is it easy to insert it along with the rest of the code on the clock in this place? 

2 question - what exactly and how to insert into contract_init_data? What is in the code under the word init? Or without that word? Can you show me an example, please?

As I understand it, the tact does not document how exactly the contract input data should be formed, so you need to look at the auto-gen wrappers. But that's the problem. I need to deploy the contract at the time of sending the transaction  [#47425](https://t.me/tactlang/47425)

[2024-12-14T21:25:28] **Rus Omnipotent**: Hey. Thank you for the idea.
I am experiencing some issues implementing it:

Suppose src jetton and dst jetton are of the same precision of 9 decimals.

Remind dst jetton amount = src jetton amount * exchange rate

Suppose I want to set exchange rate to 0.5 [dst/src]. I want 1 src token to be worth 0.5 dst tokens.

Since we can't work with decimal numbers, we must represent exchange rate with some precision based on both src and dst jetton decimals.

Let's set exchange rate to be 0.5 * 10^9 (9 decimals). Then:
dst jetton amount = (src jetton amount * exchange rate) / 10^9

We must also divide src jetton amount * exchange rate by the "common" decimals for src jetton amount and exchange rate.

I am not sure if this value we divide by can be set as some constant and we may provide only exchange rate...  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [46325](https://t.me/tactlang/46325)) [#47069](https://t.me/tactlang/47069)

[2024-12-12T21:06:09] **Victor Ryabinin**: Hi guys, how to calculate op_codes in tact? 
According to docs we should use CRC32 from TL-B Schema https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/crc32

but according to tact's docs we should use type signatures instead of tlb https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L935
i.e. I've got TLB and Signature from .md project file after tact building 
TLB: check_in#722bfa86 chatId:int257 = CheckIn
Signature: CheckIn{chatId:int257}

I've tried to get crc32 from signature and got 
crc32("CheckIn{chatId:int257}") = 0x7ec9b591
I've tried to use & 0x7FFFFFFF according to the 1st url and got 0xfec9b591

So, anyone knows how to get 722bfa86 opcode for CheckIn{chatId:int257} in tact?  [#46801](https://t.me/tactlang/46801)

As The Open Network evolves, its innovative features and the Tact programming language unlock new possibilities for developers. However, common mistakes can lead to vulnerabilities.

CertiK‚Äôs latest blog post highlights critical issues like data serialization, concurrency, and gas management, offering actionable insights to optimize security in Tact smart contracts. Whether you‚Äôre new to TON or a seasoned developer, these best practices are essential for building robust and secure applications.

[2024-12-12T14:02:39] **Rus Omnipotent**: I mean the whole standard. 

I find approval functionality like on Solana SPL tokens or Ethereum ERC20 tokens safer than Jetton Notifications solution, where the token transfer transaction is not reverted (bounced) even if the notification is reverted (bounced).

Also the jetton standard does not has decimals field to rely on the token precision on chain.

[2024-12-11T00:27:57] **Oleksandr**: Hey.

Created a simple counter contract on TACT

I want to know how I can interact with contract on front-end.

Found that I needed use contract wrapper from contract folder and import it to my front-end - which is weird.

On EVM I can use wagmi and ABI contract and easily  interact, but how I TON?  [#46595](https://t.me/tactlang/46595)

[2024-12-10T21:35:39] **–ØÃ®kov**: If you just want an on-chain hash that'll produce correct results (same as H-strings in FunC) for Builders/Slices (viewed as Strings) with any number of bytes allowed within account limits, then refer to this comment (soon to be in the docs).

Now, in general, whenever you expect multiple return values (tensor or tuple return types OR multiple stack values), then you have to provide a Struct to capture those. For example, it can look something like this:

struct Sha512 { h1: Int; h2: Int }
asm fun sha512(s: Slice): Sha512 { ONE HASHEXT_SHA512 UNPAIR }
asm fun twoSha512(s1: Slice, s2: Slice): Sha512 { TWO HASHEXT_SHA512 UNPAIR }
Btw, there is HASHEXTA_SHA512, which would also append the result to the provided Builder and return the new Builder. That is, no extra Structs for mapping needed :)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [46563](https://t.me/tactlang/46563)) [#46570](https://t.me/tactlang/46570)

[2024-12-10T20:46:54] **üôèüôèüôè üôè**: Good day everybody!

Can somebody help me with handling asm functions in Tact?
I am not sure if I'm doing sha512 right inside my contract:

asm fun sha512( s: Builder ): Slice
{
    ONE HASHEXT_SHA512
}

asm fun sha512Two( s1: Builder, s2: Builder ): Slice
{
    TWO HASHEXT_SHA512
}

Should it return Slice? Or Cell? Or smth else?
I know that it returns two 256 bit integers from TVM but I don't see any explanation on how to handle such data with Tact (I know that we can do it in func).

Thanks!  [#46563](https://t.me/tactlang/46563)

Is this jetton wallet should be initialized on the deploy? For me these topics is not very clear since i'm coming not from funC and blockchain. Lets say i have a simple contract witch main responsible is to distribute incoming jettons (usdt) to two wallet (let say contract owner and orginizer).

[2024-12-05T13:16:49] **Gosha Kapelyushok**: Hello!
I am working on writing an NFT Collection smart contract with on-chain generation of individual content.
I tried to rewrite this TypeScript code for building on-chain content:
export function toSha256(s: string): bigint {
    return BigInt('0x' + sha256_sync(s).toString('hex'))
}

export function toTextCell(s: string): Cell {
    return beginCell().storeUint(0, 8).storeStringTail(s).endCell()
}

export type collectionContent = {
    name: string,
    description: string,
    image: string
}

export function buildCollectionContentCell(content: collectionContent): Cell {
    const collectionContentDict = Dictionary.empty(Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.Cell())
        .set(toSha256("name"), toTextCell(content.name))
        .set(toSha256("description"), toTextCell(content.description))
        .set(toSha256("image"), toTextCell(content.image));
    
    return beginCell() 
            .storeUint(0,8)
            .storeDict(collectionContentDict)
            .endCell(); 
}
into something like this on Tact:
    fun toTextCell(text: String): Cell {
        return beginCell().storeSlice(text.asSlice()).endCell();
    }

    fun buildCollectionContentCell(content: CollectionContent): Cell {
        let collectionContentDict: map<Int, Cell> = emptyMap();
        collectionContentDict.set(sha256("name"), self.toTextCell(content.name));
        collectionContentDict.set(sha256("description"), self.toTextCell(content.description));
        collectionContentDict.set(sha256("image"), self.toTextCell(content.image));

        return beginCell()
            .storeUint(0, 8)
            .storeRef(collectionContentDict.asCell()!!) 
            .endCell();
    }
However, it‚Äôs not working as expected‚Äîthe metadata of the NFT items is coming out empty.

Could you please help me with this?  [#46015](https://t.me/tactlang/46015)

Why doesn't jetton wallet contain a receive("get_wallet_data"). This way we would be able to check the sender by extracting the code and master from the received wallet data. Of course we must trust the jetton.

I want to accept (in theory) any jetton transfers to the Vault but I must check the sender of the JettonTransferNotification is the Vault's jetton wallet every time. I don't really want to have a whitelist of supported jettons.  [#46013](https://t.me/tactlang/46013)

[2024-12-04T21:16:55] **/B4ckSl4sh\**: No. JettonNotify in unbounceable and user will lose the tokens. But nevermind, it's only his responsibility to attach enough tons (If the user builds message manually). If you are building a message for him and sending it using TonConnect, you should correctly estimate fee, and return excesses.

[2024-12-04T21:00:16] **/B4ckSl4sh\**: Best approach of interacting with Jettons can be seen here https://docs.dedust.io/recipes .

[2024-12-04T20:47:05] **Rus Omnipotent**: I see one possible solution now:

1. user transfers to the DEX's jetton wallet directly interacting with its jetton wallet (TokenTransfer) forwarding some payload and possibly ton amount

2. DEX's jetton wallet accepts TokenInternalTransfer and sends a TokenNotification with a forward payload and/or ton amount to the DEX contract itself

3. DEX contract accepts TokenNotification and processes according to the parsed payload...


Is it correct?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [45938](https://t.me/tactlang/45938)) [#45939](https://t.me/tactlang/45939)
[2024-12-04T20:39:33] **Rus Omnipotent**: Is there something like approve for jettons?

I have a DEX contract. 
A user interacts with that contract. 

During that interaction I would like to transfer user's jettons (from user's jetton wallet) to the escrow (to the jetton wallet of my DEX contract). Suppose I know jetton master's address.  [#45938](https://t.me/tactlang/45938)

                // For more complicated transfers, adjust accordingly
                forwardPayload: rawSlice("F")
What is forwardPayload? Is it some additional payload sent as a notification to a destination?  [#45936](https://t.me/tactlang/45936)

[2024-12-04T15:32:51] **Bohdan**: do I understand it correct, if I set value: 0 in the message then tons and fees will be paid by the person who sent the message?

[2024-12-03T10:31:59] **Anton Trunov**: ‚ö°Ô∏è Completely overhauled exit codes page in the documentation

Sometimes pages in the Tact documentation are more detailed than you'll find elsewhere. The exit codes page is a case in point.

Not only do you get a comprehensive description of what exit codes are, how they are defined, and which ones are reserved, but you also get a handy table of them with short descriptions and quick navigation to each exit code in the table of contents. Since each of the exit codes has its own headings, linking to a specific exit code is easier than ever!

In addition, all descriptions of compute phase exit codes show examples of how you might encounter them. And sometimes even help you to anticipate and avoid them.

By the way, for exit code 50 (not listed anywhere else), we've also described the current limits on config param 43 related to account state, max number of bits and cells in messages, and much more.

Which one is cheaper (in gas fee):

1) saving a record containing struct in a map 

2) Sending a message to another contract to retrieve data

[2024-11-21T13:58:18] **A**: Hi guys. I know that my question is somewhat irrelevant to this group and it's a reactjs question. But I want to interact with my smart contract from a react app. I have deployed a simple smart contract named "Counter". It has a simple method getCounter that returns the current value of the counter. I know how to send Increment request to increase the counter value but don't know how to read it. Can somebody help?

My reactjs code:
import { beginCell, toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { TonConnectButton, useTonConnectUI } from '@tonconnect/ui-react';
import { storeIncrement } from './contracts/counter';
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS } from './constants';

const App = () => {
  const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI();

  const transaction = {
    validUntil: Date.now() / 1000 + 60,
    messages: [
      {
        address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        amount: toNano('0.01').toString(),
        payload: beginCell()
          .store(
            storeIncrement({
              $$type: 'Increment',
              amount: 1n,
            })
          )
          .endCell()
          .toBoc()
          .toString('base64'),
      },
    ],
  };

  const handleIncrement = async () => {
    const result = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction);

    console.log('Result: ', result);
  };

  const handleGetCounter = async () => {
    // TODO: Get counter from Counter smart contract
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <TonConnectButton />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Send Increment</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleGetCounter}>Get Counter</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

My Tact code:
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message Increment {
    amount: Int as uint32
}

contract Counter with Deployable {
    // Empty init() function is present by default in all Tact contracts
    // since v1.3.0, so the following may be omitted:
    //

    counter: Int as uint32;
    id: Int as uint32;

    init(id: Int) {
        self.counter = 0;
        self.id = id;
    }

    receive("increment") {
        self.counter += 1;
    }

    receive(msg: Increment) {
        self.counter += msg.amount;
    }

    receive() {
        
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

        });
        emit(WithdrawUSDTEvent{amount: msg.amount, balance: self.myJettonAmount, sender: sender()}.toCell());
    }
But when i run the script 
export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
  const pawsPurchase = provider.open(
    PawsPurchase.fromAddress(Address.parse(CONTRACT_ADDRESS)),
  );

  // Send USDT to the contract
  await pawsPurchase.send(

[2024-11-12T17:37:35] **Andrei Shtamburg**: Hey!
Looking for an advise.
I'm developing a smart contract. Basically upon the call to the smart contract, object should be initiated, then upon other calls, it get's modified, and eventually distributes the funds.
After that I don't really need the object anymore.

So, my question is, what is the best design approach here?
Should I create 1 smart contract, deploy it, and store/clear objects 
Or should I rather deploy a new instance of smart contract upon every object creation (not even sure yet if it's possible though)?

[2024-11-11T19:45:10] **Urban**: Perhaps someone can point me in the right direction. I'm transferring Jettons w/ comments and I need to process the comment inside a contract (via jettonNotify message). Think of this like a metadata check: if metadata OK do something, if not send jettons back/do something else. The "metadata" should hold a few pieces of information, so I'm inclined to pass a map into to jetton transfer comment and somehow parse that in the contract. For the jetton transfer Im thinking about using something like this from tonutils: https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils/blob/main/tonutils/utils.py#L145 and deserializing that in the contract. But I'm probably overthinking this. Has someone done something similar or can point me in the right direction?  [#44511](https://t.me/tactlang/44511)

The function above works by calculating and storing digits of the soon-to-be hex number in a map going right to left by the number, and then composing the actual number by going in reverse, since foreach obtains entries in ascending order of key values. I didn't test it much, but figured the ideas of this function might be helpful to you elsewhere  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [44486](https://t.me/tactlang/44486)) [#44498](https://t.me/tactlang/44498)

[2024-11-11T14:39:28] **–ØÃ®kov**: Yeah, but not directly. If you have an Int, you can call .toString() on it, and then you'll have the String (Slice) with bytes of that Int, which can be represented as hex by your logic.

[2024-11-11T14:26:17] **–ØÃ®kov**: No, it is perfectly valid. But you seem to call send() ‚Äî it obviously modifies contract state and therefore not allowed inside of a getter (get fun _() {...})  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [44479](https://t.me/tactlang/44479)) [#44481](https://t.me/tactlang/44481)

so this is wrong approch that i am calling a getter function to get the value from mapping??  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [44477](https://t.me/tactlang/44477)) [#44479](https://t.me/tactlang/44479)
[2024-11-11T14:20:33] **–ØÃ®kov**: 1. Put one map inside a Struct, then use that Struct for the value type of your map

Something like:

struct Idk { m: map<Int, Int> }

fun showcase() {
    let m: map<Int, Idk> = emptyMap();
    // here you go
}
2. Nope, getter functions are only there to be called off chain. Getter cannot call another getter, but can call, say, a global function that won't modify contract state  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [44472](https://t.me/tactlang/44472)) [#44477](https://t.me/tactlang/44477)

Using the code in this link's code  I am calculating the contract's USDT address using the USDT master address intestnet and passing in the walletCode (which I take from the master's 'get_jetton_data').  I am assuming it is a hex string (https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy?section=method).  Yet, when I send USDT on testnet to my contact - it always sends it to a different address.  What could I be doing wrong? Thank you.  Code snippet: // utils.ts
import { Cell, Address } from '@ton/core';


export const USDT_MAINNET_ADDRESS = Address.parse("kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy");
export const USDT_WALLET_BYTECODE = "b5ee9c7201020f010003d1000114ff00f4a413....";


export function hexToCell(hex: string): Cell {
    const bytes = Buffer.from(hex, 'hex');
    return Cell.fromBoc(bytes)[0]; // Convert the byte buffer to a Cell

[2024-11-04T11:59:49] **Laisky Cai**: If a transaction includes multiple sends and you wish to have precise control over the value, you might need to follow the implementation I provided. This ensures that you can control each send's value accurately, while also confirming that the ctx.value is enough to cover all sends. Additionally, use nativeReserve to protect the contract's balance, and refund any remaining ctx.value.

For the same reason that you cannot use SendRemainingValue, I think that you also cannot use self.forward.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [43860](https://t.me/tactlang/43860)) [#43861](https://t.me/tactlang/43861)

I had two ideas:

1. Simply add require(context().value >= ton(‚Äú0.25‚Äù)) and in the end of the function do self.forward to send the excess TONs back

2. Change the value of the minting transaction from ton(‚Äú0.1‚Äù) into context().value / 2 - ton(‚Äú0.05‚Äù) 

But none of them seem elegant. If we only had one jetton minting call, I could use the flag SendRemainingValue, but since I have two similar calls, I‚Äôm not sure how to do that properly  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [43858](https://t.me/tactlang/43858)) [#43860](https://t.me/tactlang/43860)

let deployer: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;
let bridge: SandboxContract<Bridge>;

deployer = await blockchain.treasury("deployer");

bridge = blockchain.openContract(
      await Bridge.fromInit(deployer.address, deployer.address, pub_key)
);

Next I want to make Mint tokens to some address:
const deployTokenResult = await fungibleToken.send(
  deployer.getSender(),
  {
    value: toNano("0.05"),
  },
  {
    $$type: "Mint",
    amount: supply,
    receiver: bridge.address,
  }
);

The point is that the owner of the token is bridge, not deployer, so I need to send this transaction from bridge, because in the mint function there is a check on the owner, but I can not use getSender method for bridge, only for deployer, how to solve this?  [#43797](https://t.me/tactlang/43797)

[2024-11-01T16:47:00] **poppa**: If you have the pool identifier yes you can query it from another contract, however because it would be N asynchronous queries to the N pools being queried the pool states you‚Äôre comparing cannot be considered equivalent. It is entirely possible for another mutation to occur prior to your contract being able to act upon the information. 

For example, if you query NOT-USDT then query TON-USDT, compare the values and determine NOT is a better opportunity (or whatever), there‚Äôs no guarantee that the state will be the same as observed for either pool by the time you perform a swap.  [#43723](https://t.me/tactlang/43723)

[2024-10-30T19:06:37] **S Kyslynsky**: This question is not related to the Tact language, but there are few examples of jetton multisenders and misunderstandings arise.

I already have a jetton and jetton wallet contract.
I'm trying to implement a multisender contract, nothing complicated just receiving the recipients and jetton amount in msg then transfer in a loop. So my multisender can't store the jettons by itself (obviously), only on the jetton wallet instance that was created for him automatically (as I can understand), obviously I have to run the multisend function with "multisenderJettonWallet.send ... { $$type: 'MultiSend' ...}," but it can't accept this message because the jetton wallet contract itself can't receive this type of message.

So the question arises whether it would be a good practice to implement the multisend logic directly in the main jetton wallet contract and remove the multisender contract altogether or are there any other approaches to implementation?  [#43623](https://t.me/tactlang/43623)

[2024-10-29T16:12:01] **Guy**: Hi :), sorry if I keep coming back to this, but it is unclear to me.  In this tutorial, for USDT, we have: struct JettonWalletData {
    status: Int as uint4;
    balance: Int as coins;
    ownerAddress: Address;
    jettonMasterAddress: Address;
}

// And the function to calculate the wallet address may look like this:
fun calculateJettonWalletAddress(
    ownerAddress: Address,
    jettonMasterAddress: Address,
    jettonWalletCode: Cell
): Address {

    let initData = JettonWalletData{
        status: 0,
        balance: 0,
        ownerAddress,
        jettonMasterAddress,
    };

    return contractAddress(StateInit{
        code: jettonWalletCode,
        data: initData.toCell(),
    });
}.  My questions are: 1.  All of the JettonWallet implementations I saw take in as constructor input parameters the owner address and the master contract address.  Should the USDT wallet take in as input the JettonWalletData struct? or should it take 4 paramters: status, balance, ownerAddress, jettonMasterAddress? 2. type 'uint4' does not exist in Tact, how should I define the status parameter then? Is there a way to limit integers in tact to the range of [0,15].  3. What is this status parameter? Should I store it as a state variable in the wallet implementation? Any help on this would be much much appreciated üôè .  If anyone has an example of a USDT wallet in tact and doesn't mind sharing it - also much appreciated.

[2024-10-28T15:11:40] **Denys**: Hi all, please help me with a problem, I have a contract to which the user transfers Jetton, the situation is like this, Jetton is transferred in three stages:
1. the first transaction is the user calls the tokenTransfer method of his Jetton wallet, where he passes the necessary data, such as the address of the recipient, the number of tokens to be transferred, etc.
2. the second transaction is tokenTransfer sends the tokenTransferInternal message to the recipient's wallet.
3. the third transaction is sending a tokenNotification message to the owner's address from the Jetton wallet contract.
my contract has a method that processes the tokenNotification message and in case something goes wrong, it should rollback the transaction. But the problem is that it can only roll back the transaction with tokenNotification message, but the token transfer itself (which was in transaction 2) cannot be rolled back, how can I solve this problem?

[2024-10-28T12:37:50] **Sergey**: Hi everyone.
I am new in TON ecosystem.
Right now I starting with Tact language.
I have experience in Solidity smart contracts.
I understand, that concept of Tact and TON ecosystem is not the similar with EVM, it is clear.
Could somebody guide me  (or give an example) how to implement the following scenario in Tact.

Scneario in EVM (solidity)
Contract USDTReceiver
- contract accept payments in USDT from various users.
- contract tracks the total amount of payments from any user.
- control allows to withdraw all usdt by the admin (doesn't matter why)

From the tech part, the user must call the method ERC20.approve({USDTReceiver}, {mount}).
And then contract USDTReceiver is able to call the method ERC20.sendTransferFrom() to charge/transfer usdt from the user to contract.

How to do the same in Tact?
Not sure, Jetton template has similar concept like approve and sendTransferFrom.
Apparently another approach is used to accept USDT Jetton (or any other external jetton) inside Tact smart contract methods.

Please help to figure out with TON and Tact code.
Thanks in advance  [#43512](https://t.me/tactlang/43512)
[2024-10-28T11:50:40] **Nikita Aplin**: Is there a human way to get txHash from sendTransfer?

Now the logic is:
1) Received seqno BEFORE
2) Sent the transaction
3) Waited for seqno to change
4) Called the list of last transactions via the toncenter and took the last one

The doc says let transfer = await userWallet.sendTransfer(...)
BUT transfer is an empty void

P.S.

import { TonClient, WalletContractV4 } from '@ton/ton';
    let wallet = WalletContractV4.create({ workchain, publicKey: keyPair.publicKey });
    let userWallet = tonClient.open(wallet);  [#43511](https://t.me/tactlang/43511)

__tact_dict_get_uint_int($self'projects, 64, $projectId, 257);
$self'projects~__tact_dict_set_uint_int(64, $msg'projectId, $msg'rate, 257)


hovewer in a generated ts file it is way different:


b_0.storeDict(src.projects, Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(64), Dictionary.Values.BigUint(124));


seems line value size does not work in FunC and wrong on ts side (should be Dictionary.Values.BigVarUint(16) as i remember)  [#43294](https://t.me/tactlang/43294)

and I'm trying to somehow process this event in blueprint tests to check if all the data is passed correctly:
const transferResult = await bridge.send(receiver.getSender(), { value: toNano('0.5') }, fundsOutMessage);

[2024-10-21T13:36:31] **Georgiy Komarov**: That's right. You should also care about the amount of data you're going to store in the cell. It should not exceed 1023 bits, otherwise, it will fail with the Cell Overflow runtime error.

        return hash;

[2024-10-20T12:05:56] **Max**: The problem is not really in storing balances, but in the ability to liquidate loans when the price changes, given that our parent contract determines the price of the asset. So, when the parent (a uniswap v2-like pool) contract understands that the price reaches a certain point, it may want to liquidate some loans. 

The only way I see is offchain tracking with incentives for liquidators  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [42970](https://t.me/tactlang/42970)) [#42972](https://t.me/tactlang/42972)

My name is Sergey, and I‚Äôm with the DeFi Canvas project. We participated in the TON Bootcamp from October 11-13, and now we are #lookingfor reinforcements.

We are preparing a DeFi product for TON Hackers, aiming to release an MVP by the end of November. Currently, we are looking for:

- Frontend Developer: Experienced in TWA, React, and API integrations. Knowledge of TON is a plus.
FunC/Tact Developer: Knowledge of TWA, swap functions, and liquidity interactions.

We already have a concept, mockups, a testnet solution, and a working backend. Now, we are finalizing the scope, prioritizing features, and distributing tasks. As a startup, we are budget-conscious and primarily focused on earning rewards from TON Hackers winter. However, we have a small budget to cover operational expenses for the next month.

If you're interested or know someone who might be, feel free to DM me for more details. Thanks, everyone! :)

struct JettonWalletData {

function from JettonWallet - 
override inline fun calculate_jetton_wallet_init(owner_address: Address): StateInit {

        return contractAddress(initCode);

Yet in my tests I get two diffrent wallets, I am loosing my mind
 let masterPredictedWallet = await jettonMaster.getGetWalletAddress(MyCoolContract.address)

        console.log(await MyCoolContract.getJettonWallet()) // EQCEMrJerbRirCbXmbDXNik03AmvErXe5_yYR9ZINwNHWFFS

The code below works fine.

let b_0 = new Builder();
b_0.storeAddress(sender);

await userWallet.send(
    ‚Ä¶
    ‚Ä¶
    {
        ‚Ä¶

But the code below has this error ‚ÄúBitBuilder overflow‚Äù.

b_0.storeAddress(sender);
b_0.storeAddress(sender);

[2024-10-03T23:10:25] **Sergey Vertepov**: Guys, hello. 
Could you please help me? 
I'm building a payload to send jetton like this: 

transferPayload := cell.BeginCell().
 MustStoreUInt(sendJettonOpCode, 32).
 MustStoreUInt(uint64(messageID), 64).
 MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromDecimal(fmt.Sprintf("%f", amount), jettonData.Decimals).Nano()).
 MustStoreAddr(h.contractAddress).
 MustStoreAddr(parsedSenderAddress).
 MustStoreBoolBit(false).
 MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.05").Nano()).
 MustStoreBuilder(forwardPayload).
 EndCell()


also I calculate jettonAddress of the sender this way:


token := jetton.NewJettonMasterClient(api, address.MustParseAddr(jettonData.MasterContract))

senderTokenWallet, err := token.GetJettonWallet(ctx, parsedSenderAddress)
if err != nil {
 h.log.Error().Err(err).Msg("failed to get wallet for sender")

 return "", "", err
}


but when I'm trying to send such transaction i see this. 

if i send such transcation i will get 49 exit code. I couldn't find any info about this code. 

but the most interesting part - the same code works perfectly in testnet. 

maybe someone can help me?  [#41876](https://t.me/tactlang/41876)

There is a smart contract on the clock for accepting payments:

------------

import "@stdlib/deploy";

message Payment {
    orderId: Int as uint32;
}

message PaymentReceived {
    orderId: Int as uint32;
    amount: Int as coins;
    sender: Address;
}

contract PaymentReceiver with Deployable {
    owner: Address;
    
    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
    }

    receive(msg: Payment) {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        
        // Check that the transfer amount is greater than 0
        require(ctx.value > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");
        
        // We will issue an event about the received payment
        emit(PaymentReceived{
            orderId: msg.orderId,
            amount: ctx.value,
            sender: ctx.sender
        }.toCell());

        // We send funds to the owner of the contract
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.owner,
            value: ctx.value - ton("0.1"), // We leave a little for the commission
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
            bounce: false
        });
    }

    // Handler for the "withdraw" text message, allowing the owner to withdraw funds
    receive("withdraw") {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.owner,
            value: myBalance() - ton("0.1"), // We leave a little for the commission
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
            bounce: false
        });
    }

    get fun owner(): Address {
        return self.owner;
    }
}

------------

at the front, I am forming a transaction and trying to form the correct body for the payload

------------

import type { SendTransactionRequest, SendTransactionResponse } from '@tonconnect/sdk'
import { TonConnectButton, useTonAddress, useTonWallet, useTonConnectUI } from '@townsquarelabs/ui-vue'
import { beginCell, Address, toNano } from "@ton/core";
import { storePayment, Payment } from ' ./tact_PaymentReceiver'; // Importing the necessary functions from the generated file

...

const { order_id, amount, payment_address } = paymentInfo.value

const payment: Payment = {
  $$type: 'Payment',
  orderId: BigInt(order_id)
};

const testAmount = 0.05 //test amount

const body = beginCell()
    .store(storePayment(payment))
    .endCell();


// Forming
a const transaction = {
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 600, // Transaction duration (10 minutes)
  messages: [
{
address: payment_address, // Contract address
      amount: toNano(testAmount.toString()).toString(), // Payment amount
      stateInit: undefined,
      payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64'),
    }
  ]
};

paymentStatus.value = 'sending'
const result: SendTransactionResponse = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction)

------------

as soon as I didn't try to generate a correct payload, an error occurs every time 'it is not possible to verify the transaction'

But if you comment out the payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64') line, then the transaction is created and confirmed in the wallet successfully  [#41832](https://t.me/tactlang/41832)

I assume you can implement your own sha256 that pulls data iteratively from cells and their refs and put everything in other cells. Sort of. The main peril here is that it's unattractive to debug it. Also, tx cost isn't cheap

If that's possible use another algorithm (CRC f.e., but I wouldn't use it if data is sensitive) or even Merkle trees based on easier hash  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [41809](https://t.me/tactlang/41809)) [#41825](https://t.me/tactlang/41825)

I need verify that a hash is correctly created. I want to hash an object with a varying size between 200 and 500 Bytes (4000 bits).

However, I cannot stored all of this in a cell without references. According to the docs, this implies I cannot sha256 hash it. It this true?

Can you recommend something to read or watch regarding gas payments in contracts on TON?

Right now, I don't understand who pays the gas and when.
We keep the balance non-zero, and I understand why. However, I'm unsure how the gas is deducted from contracts that have used up their entire balance.
And how do you control all of this when writing contracts in Tact?

Thanks!  [#41428](https://t.me/tactlang/41428)

[2024-09-25T21:22:10] **Jose Fabio**: Tact's documentation says
The optional flag SendIgnoreErrors means that even when an error occurs during message sending next messages would be sent anyway. No error during the sending phase would revert a transaction.

It doesn't explain why many people use it. Is it safe? Wouldn't it be desirable to revert a transaction if an error occurs?  [#41308](https://t.me/tactlang/41308)

[2024-09-25T18:06:55] **Jb**: Hello, I am dealing with an async problem here. 
I am trying to create infinite maps, and a solution proposed is to deploy a new mapping on an empty contract that holds that value such as jetton does. Every time I execute a function in my c ontract, the a new value is inserted in the mapping, and each value is related to each other like a chain. And I need to also query the new contract. My problem comes when that call might fail, and I need to revert changes. I tried putting a bounced method but it is not easy to revert a hashchain  in the mapping, moreover when I might have many calls at the same time.  [#41296](https://t.me/tactlang/41296)
[2024-09-25T18:06:41] **Anton Trunov**: also, for roles you might use a smaller integer, let‚Äôs say 8-bit or even 4-bit integer  [#41295](https://t.me/tactlang/41295)

[2024-09-25T17:25:52] **Dmitriy Mozhevitin**: so you either need to rework your contract to support only some whitelisted set of jettons or accept jetton wallet address (or code) as an argument
but for the latter case you also need to come up with some validation to make sure that jetton wallet address indeed corresponds to a certain jetton master  [#41285](https://t.me/tactlang/41285)
[2024-09-25T17:23:46] **Dmitriy Mozhevitin**: there is also a discoverable jettons standard (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md)
where jetton master has provide_wallet_address method to return (asynchonously, of course) the jetton wallet address

but not every jetton is a discoverable jetton, so you can‚Äôt rely on it  [#41284](https://t.me/tactlang/41284)
[2024-09-25T17:21:59] **Dmitriy Mozhevitin**: it makes things harder
in case of some limited set of jettons, I‚Äôd sugget you to store the map from jetton master address to jetton wallet address in your contract

then you need to accept the jetton wallet address (or cell with code) as an input in your tact contract to calculate jetton wallet address from it
in general it‚Äôs impossible to calculate jetton master -> jetton wallet address mapping since different jettons may have different code  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [41282](https://t.me/tactlang/41282)) [#41283](https://t.me/tactlang/41283)

[2024-09-25T17:11:47] **Dmitriy Mozhevitin**: you only need to know your jetton wallet address when sending jettons
as for recepient, you need the recipient address, not recipient‚Äôs jetton wallet one, it will be calculated by your jetton wallet, so it‚Äôs not your concern

you should know your jetton wallet address, so there should be no problems in it  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [41271](https://t.me/tactlang/41271)) [#41277](https://t.me/tactlang/41277)

[2024-09-25T16:57:46] **Laisky Cai**: I think your question is very strange. If you want to transfer jetton/NFT, then you must know the contract code, and therefore, initof must be able to get the correct address.

1) user creates a list, on the parent contract i store their address and the id on a map
2) on a third contract i want to check the state of the child-todo, so i would need to use the parent-todo to access the auth info and deny access to the user if its not the owner

A todo list is pretty simple, but lets say i want to offer this to several users. In that case, what are some ideas to implement a basic auth here, as it would defeat its purpose if anyone could go and interact with the parent contract, modifying other users todo list.

tl;dr: Tact is a safer, more high-level alternative that won't let you shoot yourself in the foot with error-prone low-level stuff. But in some projects you'll need to write some logic in FunC and integrate it to Tact in order to optimize things or involve low-level constructions.

[2024-09-19T09:57:16] **Anton Trunov**: prevKeyBlock in your FunC code should return a tensor (int, int, int, int, int), not a tuple tuple or not even a concrete tuple [int, int, int, int, int]  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [40906](https://t.me/tactlang/40906)) [#40908](https://t.me/tactlang/40908)
[2024-09-19T08:23:21] **Jb**: for the func file:
tuple prevKeyBlock() asm "PREVKEYBLOCK 5 UNTUPLE";

and in my tact contract:

struct BlockId {

}

    get fun getPrevKeyBlock() : BlockId {

[2024-09-19T07:03:38] **Anton Trunov**: Tact currently does not really support tuples, but if you only need some specific part of the block information, you could have done something like this (beware of bugs in the following code, I didn‚Äôt test it):


struct BlockId {
    wc: Int;
    shard: Int;
    seqno: Int;
    root_hash: Int;
    file_hash: Int;
}

asm fun prevKeyBlock(): BlockId {
    PREVKEYBLOCK
    5 UNTUPLE
}


Btw, Sandbox does not emulate blocks, so all those tuples should be empty in your local tests.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [40894](https://t.me/tactlang/40894)) [#40895](https://t.me/tactlang/40895)

[2024-09-17T00:27:02] **Denis Kartashov**: Hello!
Can't find answer by search:
In tact by example forward_payload has Slice type(as remaining)
But in docs on official site it has Cell type.
What option is correct?

We have both variants in mainnet (from two different teams) and i need to communicate with both. Should i separate them, or it's fine to pass argument with cell type (in tests Slice version accept Cell, but not vice versa).
P.S. in theory we can redeploy Slice version if nothing wrong with Cell and it's be better for future interactions.  [#40748](https://t.me/tactlang/40748)

[2024-09-15T18:47:06] **Anton Trunov**: üéâ Tact v1.5.0 has just been released

The new Tact release v1.5.0 just landed on NPM! Here are the highlights of the most important features.

üõ† New Tact features

asm functions allow you to access the deep dark corners of TVM for more features or better performance: 


asm fun keccak256(s: Slice): Int {
    1 INT HASHEXT_KECCAK256
}


asm functions have some limitations at this point and the Tact team will make them even more powerful in the next releases.

- A wider range of serialization options for integers can now be used, not just 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit integers, but anything in between: uint1 through uint256 and int1 through int257. For instance, a 48-bit timestamp can be defined now if you'd like to build contracts that can work after the year 2038:


contract Contract {
    timestamp: Int as uint48
}


- Constant definitions now support calls to user-defined functions and references to other constants:


const CONSTANT: Int =
    myFunction(OTHER_CONSTANT)


üë©‚Äçüíª New builtin and stdlib functions and methods

- The exists method for the Map type: m.exists(key) which is equivalent to m.get(key) != null.

- The deepEquals method for the Map type: m1.deepEquals(m2) -- you can now easily compare two maps with the same key-value pairs and get true as the result, even if their internal representations are different, so the hash-based == comparison would return false.

- The toSlice method for structs and messages: struct.toSlice().

- The new slice, rawSlice, ascii and crc32 built-in compile-time functions to help you define constant integers and slices more conveniently.

- The new stdlib functions to help with fee calculations: gasConsumed, getComputeFee, getStorageFee, getForwardFee, getSimpleComputeFee, getSimpleForwardFee, getOriginalFwdFee, myStorageDue. This brings you access to the TVM instructions from 2023.07 and 2024.04 upgrades.

- The parseStdAddress and parseVarAddress stdlib functions allow you to parse slices into structured addresses.

üêû The new release also includes a bunch of bugfixes. Thanks to all the Tacticians for all the issues you open!

two points worth mentioning, though:

I‚Äôm building a smart contract that needs to send notifications (messages) to users for certain events.

[2024-09-08T13:08:55] **Daniil Kananenka**: Hi guys!

Does anybody know how to calculate a hash of the struct?

I receive internal msg with struct Item:
struct Item {

    prop2: String;

}
and I wanna save its hash with price in a small map like a catalog. If I use 
sha256(msg.item.toCell().asSlice())
 it returns the same hash for all incoming items (probably because it hashes only ref cell). So what is be the best approach of hasing a stuct with string fields (taking into account, that sha256 is relatively havy hash func and I can stand with lighter hashing)?

I have some difficulties with the multiple mint in one function...
One time mint works, but more than two fails, can't see the error, just said that failed transaction.

    receive("Owner: Airdrop") {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Not Owner");
        // self.mint(self.airdrop_info.communityWallet, 5000000000, self.owner);
        // self.mint(self.airdrop_info.earlyContributorsWallet, 5000000000, self.owner);
        // self.mint(self.airdrop_info.listingAndLiquidityWallet, 5000000000, self.owner);
        self.mint(self.airdrop_info.developmentWallet, 5000000000, self.owner);

[2024-09-05T11:50:56] **Daniil Sedov**: sender is not a public key.

what exactly are you trying to solve using checkSignature? If you're checking the incoming message source - it's enough to compare addresses. If you're working with some external entities then you usually just store their public key in contract.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [39983](https://t.me/tactlang/39983)) [#39989](https://t.me/tactlang/39989)

[2024-08-30T13:45:39] **Nerses**: In my smart contract on the TON blockchain, the protocol requires a user to complete two transactions for successful execution. To streamline the process, I've removed the need for the user to perform the second transaction themselves. Instead, during the first transaction, the user provides their signature, which allows an LP (Liquidity Provider) to execute the second transaction on their behalf.

I need to ensure that during the second transaction, I can verify that the provided signature indeed belongs to the user, using only the information available within the smart contract. Although one approach is to store the user's public key during the first transaction, I would prefer a more secure and efficient method, such as leveraging the TVM instruction ecrecover or other techniques to verify the signature's ownership without explicit key storage. What would be the best approach to achieve this?  [#39667](https://t.me/tactlang/39667)

[2024-08-30T04:18:17] **Tiqan**: I know that already. Sadly that doesnt really work for my usecase i think.

Contract A has an initOf Contract B to get the address of Contract B and send a message to it

Contract B has an initOf Contract A to check if the message comes from Contract A  [#39644](https://t.me/tactlang/39644)

Let's say we have a pool from a platform like DeDust, and the pool has a method to get reserves, and I need to monitor changes in the reserves in real-time. Initially, I thought of doing it this way: subscribing to the transaction stream for the pool, and as soon as a new transaction comes in, calling the contract method. But I'm using RPC, and I don't have my own node. As a result, the request to get the reserves takes about 200ms. Is it possible to implement this faster, preferably in real-time?

receive(msg: SellToken){

        require(ctx.value >= self.min_fee, "Insufficient funds");
        require(self.county_tokens.get(msg.country) != null, "Country token not found");
        let country: Country = self.county_tokens.get(msg.country)!!;
        require(country.sellable, "Country token not sellable");
        let ton_amount: Int = (msg.amount * self.sell_rate * pow(10, 9)) / 100_000;
        dump(ton_amount);
        require(ton_amount > 0, "Invalid amount");

        send(SendParameters{
                to: country.address,
                value: ton("0.02"),
                mode: SendIgnoreErrors,

        send(SendParameters{to: ctx.sender, value: ton_amount, bounce: true, mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors});

the function will burn the Tokens and then send the ton_amount to the sender  [#39485](https://t.me/tactlang/39485)

[2024-08-26T21:10:40] **Nerses**: I'm working on a smart contract that involves verifying a signed message on-chain. The contract receives a message with several fields, including signature, data, and a few others. The contract first checks the validity of the signature before proceeding with any further logic.

I've implemented the off-chain message signing using ton-crypto and passed the signed message to the contract, but the signature verification fails on-chain. I'm not sure if I'm missing something in the signing process or if there's an issue with how the contract verifies the signature.

Could someone help me figure out what might be going wrong? I've provided the relevant parts of the code in this GitHub Gist. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!  [#39318](https://t.me/tactlang/39318)

[2024-08-23T18:15:21] **Illia Malovanyi**: i haven't seen real-world applications for this case

your contract can sand a maximum of 255 actions per one contract call

if you have <= 255 actions (send_raw_message = 1 action)

then i would just loop over them and send all the messages in one transaction

if you have more transactions, then it may have sense to sort of recursively transfer transactions;

whats you case  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [39062](https://t.me/tactlang/39062)) [#39063](https://t.me/tactlang/39063)
[2024-08-23T18:12:20] **Tom - Bushi**: in my case it would be A->B -> A -> C -> A -> ... etc so I take it I can run them in parallel and it wont be some kind of anti-pattern?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [39061](https://t.me/tactlang/39061)) [#39062](https://t.me/tactlang/39062)
[2024-08-23T18:08:25] **Illia Malovanyi**: from my experience, if you have a message that bounces for some reason, it will be easier to revert the changes if you have a smaller chain of transactions

e.g.

the chain: A -> B -> C -> D -> E

E bounces message, now D reverts changes and sends to C to revert changes, then C reverts and sends to B, etc.

if you have a chain like A -> E, then E bounces and A simply reverts changes

if you don't handle bounces, then it doesn't matter, but it's strongly recommended that you handle all bounces  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [39060](https://t.me/tactlang/39060)) [#39061](https://t.me/tactlang/39061)

            deployer.getSender(),

                forward_payload: Cell.EMPTY.asSlice()
            }
        );

        expect(jettonNotifyWalletResponse.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployer.address,
            to: testWallet.address,
            success: true,
        });

        const usdtBalance = await testWallet.getGetUsdtBalance();
        expect(usdtBalance).toBe(10n);
    });  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [39053](https://t.me/tactlang/39053)) [#39056](https://t.me/tactlang/39056)

[2024-08-23T13:37:28] **Urban**: Can someone explain what am doing wrong here? Im trying to handle JettonTransferNotification messages inside my contract, but nothing happens (on testnet anyway). The expected result would be that the usdt_balance would be / msg.amount. However when calling the getter function its still 0. Is this a testnet thing or am I doing something really wrong?

[2024-08-22T17:13:44] **Max**: Hi everyone!

Is it possible to handle transfers of several different jettons in a single transaction?

For instance, can a user send a pair of USDT and another token in a single transaction? And is it possible to handle such cases in a smart contract?  [#38978](https://t.me/tactlang/38978)
[2024-08-22T14:03:11] **Georgiy Komarov**: üéâ Misti 0.2 has just landed on NPM!

üîç Five New Tact Detectors: –°onstant Address, Branch Duplicate, `dump` Is Used, Field Initialized Twice, Prefer Augmented Assignment.

üõ† Blueprint Support: Introducing the new Blueprint Plugin.

[2024-08-22T07:36:53] **Laisky Cai**: If I emitted a struct message in a contract, and I would like to know how to retrieve this message off-chain. I found this document ( https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/debug#logging-parsing ), but it doesn't explain how to retrieve the externals.body from the transaction.

for example, At the bottom of this page, there's an external-out message, which I suspect is the log emitted from my contract. How can I access this body through the client?

btw, the struct of message is 
message WalletManifestChangedEvent {
    oldManifestUrl: String;
    newManifestUrl: String;
}
----------------------------
I found the solution

get trace from https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/traces/<TX_ID>, 

curl -s https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/traces/db96ca304b4126371b15db4ba4f64f8e7bcbffec8581c019abafc16b2eae9733 | jq '.children[-1].children[-1].transaction.out_msgs[-1].raw_body'

const cells = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(hexmsg, 'hex'));

[2024-08-18T01:16:59] **Ashwin**: Unless I ask users to use a ton-keeper wallet  [#38539](https://t.me/tactlang/38539)
[2024-08-18T01:16:25] **Ashwin**: And what I learnt here is both are not possible  [#38538](https://t.me/tactlang/38538)
[2024-08-18T01:16:16] **Ashwin**: For my particular usecase, I just want the users to 
a) make a smart-contract call via their "telegram-wallet"
or
b) sign an off-chain message approving an action  [#38537](https://t.me/tactlang/38537)
[2024-08-18T01:12:42] **Ashwin**: even if it's inside telegram  [#38534](https://t.me/tactlang/38534)
[2024-08-18T01:12:31] **Ashwin**: Not sure if many would be interested in downloading a wallet  [#38533](https://t.me/tactlang/38533)
[2024-08-18T01:12:00] **Ashwin**: Yeah it will be centralized. But there could be off-ramps to get to full self custody for those who need  [#38532](https://t.me/tactlang/38532)
[2024-08-18T01:11:26] **Ashwin**: It's truly a shame that we can't use Telegram wallet for everything TON related. It would be a true unlock to the web3 eco  [#38531](https://t.me/tactlang/38531)

[2024-08-18T01:06:30] **Ashwin**: Im talking about how it's almost impossible as a dev to requests arbitrary signatures from the user from an app  [#38522](https://t.me/tactlang/38522)

If you are asking a question, ask it properly. We dont know about what you are working on as well as your entire codebase. 

What you choose to mention is the only info we have. 

Dont ask questions as if you are dropping a bomb in haste and expect someone to answer you. Provide as much detail as you want to solve your problem and very preferably give a link to the entire codebase or at least all relevant parts.

And do the basic things.. format your code, get rid of typos, etc etc..  [#38367](https://t.me/tactlang/38367)

I added dump for forward_payload I try to parse into struct (exact place where I get 9 exit code) and faced with strange behaviour. Here is place where I send message (jetton wallet contract):
if (msg.forward_ton_amount > 0) {
            dump(msg.forward_payload);
            send(SendParameters{
                to: self.owner,
                value: msg.forward_ton_amount,

                bounce: false,
                body: TokenNotification {
                    queryId: msg.queryId,
                    amount: msg.amount,
                    from: msg.from,
                    forward_payload: msg.forward_payload
                }.toCell()
            });
        }

and here is place where I receive it:

receive(msg: TokenNotification) {
        dump("TokenNotification received".asComment());
        self.requireJettonWallet(myAddress());
        dump("wallet verification success".asComment());

    stakeHash: Int;
    boosterNft: Address?;
}
forwardPayload: beginCell()
                    .storeUint(0, 32)

I'm reaching out today to seek feedback on a smart contract I've been working on. It's Nft contracts which allows only whitelisted users mint NFTs. it is managed by a WhitelistManager on which owners add users to whitelist it deploy new contract that stores users whitelist info. That contract can be call by the whitelist user. User call "mintNFT" to mint nft from two contracts Cards and Pets

I've posted the code on GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/nxved/217b473ba275ddfe582b4ad0a225ea01

I'm particularly interested in getting your insights on:

Security: Are there any potential vulnerabilities or exploits in the contract?
Functionality: Does the code achieve the intended functionality as expected?
Efficiency: Can the code be optimized for better gas usage or performance?
Best Practices: Are there any coding practices or standards I should be following that I've missed?
Any feedback or suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to learning and improving the contract, so please don't hesitate to point out any areas that could be better.  [#38182](https://t.me/tactlang/38182)

to fix this (and also to fix the underflow that occurs for you in real network) change your payload construction to this:

let payload = beginCell().storeBit(true).storeRef(StonfiSwap{

      minOut: ton("0.1"),

I'm working on an nft contract but I'm totally lost  [#37344](https://t.me/tactlang/37344)
[2024-07-30T18:54:22] **ashes**: I‚Äôve checked, but it‚Äôs still needs the modification of the Jetton contract, isn‚Äôt it? I cannot do any changes to it cause it‚Äôs been deployed  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37335](https://t.me/tactlang/37335)) [#37342](https://t.me/tactlang/37342)
[2024-07-30T18:05:29] **Alfred Liang**: You should be able to receive  the transfer_notification(notify the receiver's owner) or the excess message(notify the sender).  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37334](https://t.me/tactlang/37334)) [#37340](https://t.me/tactlang/37340)
[2024-07-30T18:04:20] **Alfred Liang**: If you have left the message to handle these use case, it should be doable.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37328](https://t.me/tactlang/37328)) [#37339](https://t.me/tactlang/37339)
[2024-07-30T16:39:03] **Illia Malovanyi**: There are multiple ways to do that. You can do cell hash, slice hash and sha255 on slices in Tact. Check out https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math#sha256  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37336](https://t.me/tactlang/37336)) [#37337](https://t.me/tactlang/37337)
[2024-07-30T16:31:28] **Nikita**: Hi!

I'd like to know what can I use for hashing in Tact? All I found is workaround with Cell.hash, so first I need to build a cell with data I want to hash, but it seems strange for me, is it OK?  [#37336](https://t.me/tactlang/37336)
[2024-07-30T16:11:18] **Illia Malovanyi**: That's embedded in the standard by default. You just need to set the payload and response_destination field accordingly to the TEP-74 standard  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37334](https://t.me/tactlang/37334)) [#37335](https://t.me/tactlang/37335)
[2024-07-30T16:07:35] **ashes**: I‚Äôm implementing the staking contract, and need to communicate with my staking contract via messages when user sends token to our hot wallet Jetton contract. Basically, user sends jettton to my wallet - my wallet sends the message to staking contract  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37333](https://t.me/tactlang/37333)) [#37334](https://t.me/tactlang/37334)
[2024-07-30T16:05:29] **Illia Malovanyi**: theoretically, you could have done that; you could provide a setter that changes the code of the wallet that is going to be deployed if there's no wallet yet; but it's very much low-level thing that's, as of now, will be likely possible only though quite complex FunC engineering; therefore, practically, that's not the case in Tact yet;

what's your use case? you could change the architecture  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37328](https://t.me/tactlang/37328)) [#37333](https://t.me/tactlang/37333)
[2024-07-30T13:29:13] **ashes**: If the master jetton already been minted, is there a way to create a new instance of jettonWallet with some modifications (send additional message on receive)? As I see from the tact example - there's no way to do that, right?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37320](https://t.me/tactlang/37320)) [#37328](https://t.me/tactlang/37328)

[2024-07-30T12:58:27] **Nerses**: Hello everyone,

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on! We've developed a new protocol called PreHTLC, an evolution of the traditional HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract) designed for crypto asset transfers. This protocol aims to facilitate truly permissionless and trustless cross-chain asset transactions.

We're providing a user-friendly UI along with the necessary links and access to our GitHub repository for those interested in diving into the code or providing feedback.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

maybe this function will be helpful for you
this function creates on-chain metadata and returns Cell type

maybe reversing this function logic from Tonion can help you :


https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/57e84a223798db5a43ffe57250baa0928a288ff2/tests/tokens/jetton/jettonHelper.ts#L18ma  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [37059](https://t.me/tactlang/37059)) [#37093](https://t.me/tactlang/37093)
[2024-07-26T03:24:22] **Tonion Dev**: Hi Nerses
when you try to send the token to someone else, the Jetton master contract computes the init.data and init.code and sends a Tx, if the receiver wallet has an instance of that Jetton wallet, it will receive the tokens and his balance will increment, otherwise, a new Jetton wallet will deploy for receiver and then the transferred token amount will be added to the receiver Jetton Wallet

you can find a sample of a function that calculates the init in Tonion 

abstraction:

[2024-07-24T15:42:35] **Guy**: Hi, I have a design question regarding sharding.  Does it make sense to have a parent contract that deploys all child contracts and maintains a map of their addresses. In such a scheme, all requests are received by the parent contract and routed to the respective child contract. The parent remains relatively 'thin' but still holds a map. Or, should the parent deploy the child contract, and then have the users interact directly with the child contract? In this scheme the parent contract acts pretty much as a deployer and is very thin in the sense that no map is required. What are some pros and cons of each from your experience?

[2024-07-24T11:59:00] **Anton Trunov**: Yeah, you can try to manually optimize the generated FunC code, however there are a couple more options:
- Tact supports FFI with FunC code, so you can write some gas-critical parts of your project in FunC and link that code from Tact;
- also, you can get in touch with us (the Tact team) and we might as well support your use case in the compiler if it will benefit the whole community in the long run  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [36912](https://t.me/tactlang/36912)) [#36913](https://t.me/tactlang/36913)
[2024-07-24T11:54:13] **Nikita**: You are right, I got your idea. Yes, I'm going to build staking contract and I have low experience in TON dev. I am experienced with Solidity and EVM btw, but in TON there significant differences from them.

Even if Tact forces to spend more money on gas, I am better start with Tact just to achieve my contract working well and later I can dive into gas optimizations with generated FunC contracts, i believe. Thanks for this idea, for some reason I didnt think about it.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [36911](https://t.me/tactlang/36911)) [#36912](https://t.me/tactlang/36912)
[2024-07-24T11:46:46] **Anton Trunov**: I say you first should build robust solutions and only then measure and fix gas issues where they needed to be fixed and not indulge in premature optimizations  [#36911](https://t.me/tactlang/36911)

[2024-07-22T22:33:26] **Alexander Gapak**: I think it depends on your task, but I guess no. In TON, it is common to deploy smart contracts on each user just to keep bool variable. If your messages have an expire time, you maybe can keep a hashmap inside one contract and clean it of expired messages, but be aware that the gas cost of hashmap operations increases with it's size and you can stuck with gas limit  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [36751](https://t.me/tactlang/36751)) [#36753](https://t.me/tactlang/36753)

[2024-07-22T22:30:30] **Alexander Gapak**: Nope, for example in architecture of jettons (fungible tokens on TON), a smart contract is deployed for each user to store a balance, and other data for the particular user. When a user sends a token transfer request to his/her jetton wallet, that contract sends a message to the recipient's jetton wallet that will verify the source (by address calculation)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [36748](https://t.me/tactlang/36748)) [#36750](https://t.me/tactlang/36750)

If it is possible, can I ask a few questions related to creating dapps? Specifically conceptual questions, not technical ones. Please dm me.  [#36686](https://t.me/tactlang/36686)

[2024-07-21T22:36:45] **Emmanel**: Unless you want to emit the the txId and catch it offline, and save it on offline db, when the user comes to claim, you can query your offchain db and perform the claim action, but that might be risky as you have to manage more security issues  [#36682](https://t.me/tactlang/36682)

I wanted to send 100 jettons to the address of the winner in my lottery

then I ran the script. The lottery winner was selected but the tokens were not sent to him.

To do this, I have built a Jetton, but 5% commission is applied to all transaction including users transfer, not only transaction from Dex.
so I thought to ignore users transfer by adding "if" statement passing only pucharge/sell from Dex.
however, to add "if" statement, I have to know already added Dex pool address. but how can I add liquidity using my Jetton don't deployed yet?
I use Tact language and it is good.
There is a upgrade method, but Tact don't allow upgrading smart contract now.
Is there any other solution you know?

I noticed that there're two kind of blocks which are masterchain and workchain, and the master blocks are incremented 1 by 1, but workchain blocks are changing randomly.

[2024-07-15T12:13:13] **Naveen Kumar**: Hi Everyone, I have a doubt regarding Validation of Signed BOC in the Backend, I am following this article as reference,
https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-ton-transactions-how-to-track-transaction-results-and-utilize-tonclient-b992336eb3a3
Here, they are getting the signed BOC from the frontend, How can I get the signed BOC in the backend as the functionality we have will initiate transactions on the backend level. Can anyone please clarify this doubt
const openedWallet = client.open(wallet);
    const seqNo = await openedWallet.getSeqno();
    const message = internal({
      to:toAddress,
      value: toNano("0.01"),
      body: beginCell().storeUint(0, 32).endCell(),
      bounce: false,
    });

    const transfer = openedWallet.createTransfer({
      secretKey: key.secretKey,
      seqno: seqNo,
      messages: [message],
    });

    const signedBOC = transfer.toBoc().toString("base64");
    const hash = transfer.hash().toString("base64");
    console.log("Signed BOC:", signedBOC);
This is what I have tried but validation is not working properly, the validation code is the following

const transaction = await this.WaitForTransaction({
      hash,
      walletAddress: openedWallet.address,
      refetchInterval: 2000,
      refetchLimit: 10,
    });
    console.log(transaction);
public static WaitForTransaction = async (options: WaitForTransactionOptions): Promise<Transaction | null> => {
    const { hash, refetchInterval = 1000, refetchLimit, walletAddress } = options;
    const client = await TonClientService.GetTonClient();
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      let refetches = 0;
      const interval = setInterval(handleTransactionCheck, refetchInterval);
      async function handleTransactionCheck() {
        refetches += 1;
        console.log("waiting transaction...");
        const state = await client.getContractState(walletAddress);
        if (!state || !state.lastTransaction) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          resolve(null);
          return;
        }
        console.log("last transaction available");
        const lastLt = state.lastTransaction.lt;
        const lastHash = state.lastTransaction.hash;
        const lastTx = await client.getTransaction(walletAddress, lastLt, lastHash);

        if (lastTx && lastTx.inMessage) {
          const msgCell = beginCell().store(storeMessage(lastTx.inMessage)).endCell();

          const inMsgHash = msgCell.hash().toString("base64");
          console.log("InMsgHash", inMsgHash);
          console.log("Hash", hash);
          if (inMsgHash === hash) {
            clearInterval(interval);
            resolve(lastTx);
          }
        }
        if (refetchLimit && refetches >= refetchLimit) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          resolve(null);
        }
      }

[2024-07-12T22:02:32] **Anton Trunov**: ‚ö°Ô∏è Added Mermaid diagrams of trait inheritance and contract dependencies to the compilation report

Did you know, that Tact produces a report of each compilation in a markdown format? If not, take a quick look at what it offers:

‚Ä¢ Resulting BoC size of the contract in bytes
‚Ä¢ TL-B schemes of all Structs and Messages alongside with their Tact signatures
‚Ä¢ List of all getter functions
‚Ä¢ List of exit codes, both default and produced by calls to require()

And now, Tact also automatically generates neat Mermaid diagrams of trait inheritance and contract dependencies, and puts them in that .md file! Check your build folders once in a while, it's definitely worth it.

[2024-07-10T12:17:58] **Max**: I‚Äôm trying to create and mint Jettons inside of another contract, but it‚Äôs not working and a transaction fails. The main question, am I initializing a jetton contract and minting tokens correctly? 

I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback, thanks!


Here‚Äôs my main contract:

receive(msg: CreateMarket) {
 let initCode: StateInit = initOf TheJetton(self.admin, "description".asComment(), 1000000000);
 
 let jettonsReceiver = address("0QDzADdEMSGsp-dMTrHaeEKBB7HCgRoVGsuk_ya03UYhcRgu");
 
 send(SendParameters{
  to: contractAddress(initCode),
  value: ton("0.25"),
  mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
  body: Mint { amount: 100000, receiver: jettonsReceiver }.toCell(),
     code: initCode.code,
  data: initCode.data
 });
}

Also here's TheJetton contract:
contract TheJetton with Jetton {
 total_supply: Int as coins;
 owner: Address;
 content: Cell;
 mintable: Bool;    
 ... everything is similar to the example from tact-by-example
}


Here's an example transaction:

How to determine if an address already exists before adding it?  [#35687](https://t.me/tactlang/35687)
[2024-07-10T04:37:07] **Illia Malovanyi**: The answer is it depends. If the message you're sending is like sum numbers a and b, then such a transaction is pretty much deterministic. It means you can actually quite well predict the fees. But if you have something that involves a loop inside, then the number of iterations and, as a result, the gas depends a lot on the actual value. You could have run a simulation, but since TON is async, that's inefficient and rather expansive. It's recommended to use a 'carry pattern' which carries all the value along the transaction to make sure that all fees are paid and then the excessive funds are returned back to someone. Take a look at TEP-74. There's a response_destination address. It will receive all the excessive funds from the transaction.

[2024-07-10T04:26:04] **Illia Malovanyi**: it doesn't say that, but fields are optional; you don't need to provide lt or transaction_hash; if you provide them though, you will get only transactions that match this pattern  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35658](https://t.me/tactlang/35658)) [#35685](https://t.me/tactlang/35685)
[2024-07-10T04:24:45] **Illia Malovanyi**: what's your use case? generally, there's no way to do that; you can include the stateinit to deploy the contract and execute the message unless it's deployed;  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35643](https://t.me/tactlang/35643)) [#35684](https://t.me/tactlang/35684)

Gas: 0.070887

While whole contract deploy needs 
Gas: 0.008681

I checked func generated, looks dump is removed from there, changed to __tact_nop();

[2024-07-06T21:00:11] **Tonion Dev**: Hi Jay 

Maybe this implementation of a basic Jetton be helpful for you:

https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mocks/tokens/jetton/basic.tact

Test:

https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/main/tests/tokens/jetton/basic/Basic.behavior.ts

Take a look at test to get your answer üòé  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35317](https://t.me/tactlang/35317)) [#35320](https://t.me/tactlang/35320)
[2024-07-06T20:58:26] **Tonion Dev**: And then try to use sandbox to simulate your contracts deployment and try to call methods like the mentioned links

FYI - @tonSniperDev  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35318](https://t.me/tactlang/35318)) [#35319](https://t.me/tactlang/35319)
[2024-07-06T20:57:17] **Tonion Dev**: Great 
Use blueprint build to build your project  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35316](https://t.me/tactlang/35316)) [#35318](https://t.me/tactlang/35318)

[2024-07-06T20:56:01] **Tonion Dev**: I suggest use blueprint to structure your project and after build your contracts it make a ts wrapper for you that you can use it in your tests our anywhere else.

For example;
This counter contract test maybe can help you:

Test:

[2024-07-06T20:51:02] **None**: How do i call this in my test script     receive(msg: StoreUserWalletMessage){

[2024-07-06T20:49:03] **None**: Okay i understand that.. So my receive msg: "CreateUserWalletMessage" i can call from my backend and store  the user ?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35309](https://t.me/tactlang/35309)) [#35310](https://t.me/tactlang/35310)
[2024-07-06T20:39:49] **Tonion Dev**: the methods marked as get are just viewable and can not change the contract states and can call from  your contract or outside of contract
but if you want to change the contract's states you should use non-get functions and call them in a wrapper function by a receiver or directly in a receiver block
actually if you are come from solidity, get methods are like view in solidity

[2024-07-05T13:50:39] **Illia Malovanyi**: You can do that as well. But if you add this into your trait, pay attention to the fact that all contracts inherited from this trait will be stoppable (and the trait needs to implement Stoppable)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35133](https://t.me/tactlang/35133)) [#35134](https://t.me/tactlang/35134)
[2024-07-05T13:46:38] **Illia Malovanyi**: That's because you need explicitly add self.requireNotStopped() before each transfer.

[2024-07-05T12:23:35] **Illia Malovanyi**: You can use TreasuryContract to send Jettons and test transactions.

Have a look at 

https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/tests/Broker.spec.ts#L52

If you specifically want to deploy a wallet, you will need to have a wrapper to interact with such a wallet. 

Have a look at how tests are done for the new wallet W5 

https://github.com/tonkeeper/w5/tree/main/tests

You can use w5 in your tests as well if u want, but I don't see much point unless you deliberately test batch transactions  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [35103](https://t.me/tactlang/35103)) [#35124](https://t.me/tactlang/35124)

[2024-07-04T13:23:20] **Daniil Sedov**: at the time when I was writing that smart contract, wallet apps such as Tonkeeper were breaking on exotic cells with merkle proofs in messages, so I made a solution with external message that can be sent without using an app

now it's possible to rewrite the code to make it a little bit cheaper and simpler  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34990](https://t.me/tactlang/34990)) [#34996](https://t.me/tactlang/34996)

i'm currently researching ways for sharding contracts on the TON blockchain, i thought that Load Balancer implemented as round robin can be very nice solution for all the smart contracts on the TON blockchain;

[2024-07-04T11:26:52] **Anton Trunov**: you can try, but it actually should not accept structs, the difference between structs and messages is the implicit ‚Äúopcode‚Äù field that every message has, it‚Äôs a tag used to dispatch. You can specify that opcode using syntax like this one:

You need to use native functions

The idea is that accept_message is inside the stdlib.fc and we create a binding to this function in the stdlib.fc

if you dont send a transaction but rather call getter from outside world(ie off-chain) you dont pay.



this getter can be used both in onchain tx (only calls from the same contract: eg receive() can call its contract getter ) and in offchain scenario(your frontend app calls getter by itself)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34712](https://t.me/tactlang/34712)) [#34742](https://t.me/tactlang/34742)

[2024-07-02T17:03:14] **Illia Malovanyi**: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/fees

Have a look at this. That's a comprehensive guide.

You must avoid storing your NFTs in the hashmap. The fees for hashmaps depend on the number of elements you store. That's unpredictable.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34681](https://t.me/tactlang/34681)) [#34687](https://t.me/tactlang/34687)

[2024-07-02T16:41:49] **Matthew Mask**: example if contract storage info of  1000 user, fee per second 0.1
2000 user fee per second still 0.1 for morethan. i think more than, so back to my above example if i have an NFT,  on first year my nft have 1000 holder, transfer fee is 0.1 ton,  but on second year my nft have 1 milllion holder, transfer fee is maybe 1 ton per transfer  [#34681](https://t.me/tactlang/34681)
[2024-07-02T16:41:27] **Illia Malovanyi**: yes, it depends on the total number of cells the contract is using

the storage fee is paid for the contract's code ('cause ultimately all the smart contracts are bags of cells)

and for the data stored at the c7 (which is a cell as well)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34679](https://t.me/tactlang/34679)) [#34680](https://t.me/tactlang/34680)
[2024-07-02T16:40:08] **Matthew Mask**: fee per second is fixed at it init contract for depend on data on contract  [#34679](https://t.me/tactlang/34679)
[2024-07-02T16:39:21] **Illia Malovanyi**: you just do

[2024-07-02T16:37:58] **Illia Malovanyi**: the storage reserve is topped up only once

[2024-07-02T16:08:10] **Matthew Mask**: If so, the longer a smart contract is deployed and the more data it has, the higher its fee will be. Imagine an nft or a token whose fees increase over time: first year fee transfer is 0.1 ton, second year fee tranfer 0. 2 ton,  ten years  5 ton üòÖ while value of nft is 0.1 ton  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34670](https://t.me/tactlang/34670)) [#34672](https://t.me/tactlang/34672)
[2024-07-02T16:06:09] **Matthew Mask**: so i should deploy new contract every year üòÖ  [#34671](https://t.me/tactlang/34671)
[2024-07-02T16:03:55] **Illia Malovanyi**: imagine you contract's balance is 1 ton

let you contract eats 0.1 ton per second

if time = 0s, then you balance is 1 ton
if time = 1s, then you balance is 0.9 ton
if time = 2s, then you balance is 0.8 ton

now someone sends some transaction to your wallet, e.g., message Add and your contract calculates the result and, using self.notify, sends the result back to the owner

the value which arrived with Add message was 0.5 ton

the total transaction fees is 0.1 ton

as a result, when the transaction arrives at t = 2s, you pay 0.3 ton worth of fees and the sender of the message gets back 0.2 ton

that's because you paid 0.1 ton of fees + the contract locks 0.2 ton from you for future storage costs


in fact, you will not have such high fees i just made them high to make the math clear  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34666](https://t.me/tactlang/34666)) [#34670](https://t.me/tactlang/34670)

[2024-07-02T15:52:58] **Illia Malovanyi**: 0.05 is like storing NFT item with offchain data for 100+ years

should be enough for most of the contracts depending how long you want them to be alive; unless you're storing your image onchain  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34663](https://t.me/tactlang/34663)) [#34665](https://t.me/tactlang/34665)
[2024-07-02T15:51:52] **Illia Malovanyi**: the storage fee is charged per one second as contract exists onchain

it means that if you add new data into your contract, the storage fee per second will increase

you will have to pay higher storage fees if you don't use your contract for a while to keep the reserve in place (if you're doing override const storageReserve = 10_000_000)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34659](https://t.me/tactlang/34659)) [#34664](https://t.me/tactlang/34664)

you can sub your address into these util to see how different addresses behave

if you want a testnet address, then you can convert it into any other by changing the prefix. i.e., the first letter (so if you want a bouncable testnet then you need the first letter to be k) and also you need to change the postfix, i.e., the last 4 letters (i.e. change them for IslI if you're doing bounceable testnet)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34627](https://t.me/tactlang/34627)) [#34632](https://t.me/tactlang/34632)

since ton blockchain is async, once you sent your message from contract A to contract B, no matter what happens to contract B (whether it rejects the transaction or processes it gracefully) the state of contract A is not changes (unlike on Ethereum where if one action fails, then everything fails; therefore you need to make sure that if you message bounces you handle it gracefully)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34613](https://t.me/tactlang/34613)) [#34618](https://t.me/tactlang/34618)

[2024-07-02T01:55:27] **Illia Malovanyi**: let's define 'usual' and 'unusual'

'usual' is when you implement master-slave (or as it's also called parent-child) pattern

e.g., you have a collection, the collection deploys NFT items;

i consider that as usual as i've always worked with such code in FunC and hence now working in Tact

'unusual' this is when Todo deploys Todo, as in your example; that's when you call initOf inside the contract itself

if you're building a referral system which has a structure similar to the linked list, then yes, that's a great pattern, but I never used it on TON 

btw that's an interesting task to do in FunC 'cause i literally haven't seen anyone doing that


i'm not involved with building tact compiler; if the question is to fix the problem, then just use 'usual' master-slave pattern

if the question is too figure out what is theoretically possible to do and the goal is not to fix staff, but to explore, then i'm likely to be not the best guide as i'm not involved with tact compilor development; i'm just a developer who tries to help others with building their web3 products

i've just tried to solve the problem ignoring that the question is like 'what theoretically i can achieve'

i'm very keen to see what this issues ends up with  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34580](https://t.me/tactlang/34580)) [#34581](https://t.me/tactlang/34581)

[2024-07-01T23:51:57] **Dmitry M1s5**: you can use hashed user secrets as random seed:
1. Starting pre-game
2. Users pay for participation
3. Users create own secrets.
4. Users hash it and send this hash in the game contract.
5. You stop pre-game. Users can enter the game no more.
6. Game starts.
7. Timelocked contract wait for players to reveal their secrets.
8. When the time ran out one can end the game. The random seed is hash of users' secrets.


If participation is too cheap one can create lots of fake players and reveal their secret only if it makes him win. You can make people pay a big fee on secret sending and repay a part of it on secret reveal  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34555](https://t.me/tactlang/34555)) [#34578](https://t.me/tactlang/34578)

[2024-07-01T12:03:23] **Illia Malovanyi**: Sending messages inside init is a bit unusual. I've been exploring what it builds into and literally init is just a faction that hashes code of the contract with data, and this data cell is constructed of the init.

[2024-07-01T10:33:51] **Renton**: Hey folks, just out of curiosity: why TON took a path of its own set of instucrions set therefore its own languages: fift and func. Why not just WASM: it has a rich instructions set: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/index-instructions.html It would make everyone's life so much f-ing easier, no fift no func no tact, just write it in rust or javascript and compile to wasm - done!

i have no problem as you described

i've also tried to clone the repo of the author of the issue, and this repo simply didn't compile ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

can u upload you code on github and share? 'cause i don't see how it can be wrong

btw calling like initOf inside the contract itself is a bit unusual

https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw/blob/main/contracts/master.tact#L13

what's the use case?

in this design, i would simply use myAddress()

it may be the reason why you got different addresses as tact < v1.4.0 may had the issue compiling such code  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34434](https://t.me/tactlang/34434)) [#34451](https://t.me/tactlang/34451)

Also not understood why you think that is different address if 

Item code
        let init: StateInit = initOf Item(self.owner, self.master);
        
        dump(self.owner);  // EQAo-FxhMEmnBKIy0KNQmSB696ozXqBO9WGmsIhf3xEB-7zF

        dump(contractAddress(init)); // EQC8MdQOQhaR0_i7mxM2aWnu5JIW7634bMrdi7234pPMn1Xb << -- DIFFERENT

and 

Master code
        let init: StateInit = initOf Item(owner_address, myAddress());

        dump(owner_address);  // EQAo-FxhMEmnBKIy0KNQmSB696ozXqBO9WGmsIhf3xEB-7zF
        dump(myAddress());  // EQDVnS5QfXUBdXnSKXQpvoJSpeN4k6Rnf6cTfnimJBNZiryp
        dump(contractAddress(init)); // EQCZxYAqIOgjpMRL2EskZoQ6NP31yH9uCqt-90u7IYPSzggk << -- DIFFERENT

In both examples is the same initial addresses for  initOf Item - the values are the equal

[2024-06-29T12:26:55] **Illia Malovanyi**: what contract is that?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34295](https://t.me/tactlang/34295)) [#34299](https://t.me/tactlang/34299)
[2024-06-29T12:25:53] **Illia Malovanyi**: if you want to get the same address using the getter function, then you need to store this addresses somewhere

the most straightforward solution is to put a getter for Item inside the Master

like using self.owner field

like get fun master() -> return myAddress() and get fun item() -> return initOf Item(self.owner, myAddress())  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34289](https://t.me/tactlang/34289)) [#34298](https://t.me/tactlang/34298)
[2024-06-29T12:23:30] **Illia Malovanyi**: so basically you derive addresses differently

you derive address for master from just owner address

we can note this as the following: hash(owner_address) -> master_address

but for item you derive the address like hash(owner_address, master_address) -> item_address

as you see, you provide different arguments when calculating the address of the contract; that's why addresses are different  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34277](https://t.me/tactlang/34277)) [#34297](https://t.me/tactlang/34297)

[2024-06-28T15:19:40] **ABCDE**: Hi all! Tell me, how much does an nft purchase transaction cost on average now? Any NFT, in any service.
My tests (not NFT) have a high commission.  [#34218](https://t.me/tactlang/34218)
[2024-06-28T15:04:41] **Konstantin T**: HI there! Is any one know why contract address is different if I'm trying get this adres directly from my contract and if I'm getting that address from jetton standard method

There are examples:

contract = await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address);

contract.address == jetton.getGetWalletAddress(gamer.address); ---> FALSE 

But code for getGetWalletAddress is the same like

    get fun get_wallet_address(owner_address: Address): Address {
        let init: StateInit = initOf MyWallet(owner_address, myAddress());
        dump(contractAddress(init));
        dump(owner_address);
        dump(myAddress());
        return contractAddress(init);
    }

so all values are correct owner_address and myAddress() in contract the same as in MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address) but always contractAddress(init) not equal  await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address).address

I'm developing one right now for the real-time on-chain market data. 

https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13423

Although it's available on the testnet already, it's not ready for production yet.  I'm planning to launch it by the end of Q3 if everything goes well

So if you need some real-time market data, I'll update you once Nenuma is launched  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34100](https://t.me/tactlang/34100)) [#34102](https://t.me/tactlang/34102)
[2024-06-27T17:57:35] **Illia Malovanyi**: I'm currently exploring how to set up a local environment like Hardhat:

https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview

The console logger is great, but imagine if we had a graphical interface like Tonviewer that shows action flows with dynamic charts. That would be a game-changer for TON development.

Unlike other blockchains, where you don't have to track tons of transactions, TON's async nature makes it super easy to get lost. Plus, architecting contracts to be scalable, like Jetton wallets or NFTs, is really tough to debug.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34099](https://t.me/tactlang/34099)) [#34101](https://t.me/tactlang/34101)
[2024-06-27T17:56:34] **Mikael**: Hello Guys. Is there any oracles for smart contracts in Tact?  [#34100](https://t.me/tactlang/34100)
[2024-06-27T17:48:15] **Anton Trunov**: really awesome stuff! would be really nice to have it integrated into the TON tooling like Blueprint/Sandbox, let‚Äôs see if we could go through the grants-and-bounties program to do that  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34098](https://t.me/tactlang/34098)) [#34099](https://t.me/tactlang/34099)
[2024-06-27T17:44:00] **Illia Malovanyi**: Yes, that's like a library that has features that I didn't find in the @ton/test-utils, but I found them very useful when developing smart contracts for Nenuma. 

There is a function in @ton/test-utils called something like printTransactionFees and it was so confusing. It was a nightmare debugging contracts with it. 

I saw lots of random fees and now idea what transaction action is failing, where this message is, etc.

I was once debugging a set of transactions that was causing 13 actions. One of my transactions was bouncing as I hadn't attached enough value to pay for the gas fees.

I spent a few hours writing expects and then just gave up and implemented a function called printTransactions. It was printing simplified fees and was showing me sources and destinations of my actions.

Then I realized that it would be good to have some labels and log contract balances from time to time. That's how I created a logger.

There's a feature in the sandbox that the first transaction was like an external transaction that brings some value. It didn't have source address and values could be null sometimes.

I was rewatching Shrek with my friend that day so I just started generating some funny ogre-style info in my console.

That's pretty much who the Shrek was born :))  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [34097](https://t.me/tactlang/34097)) [#34098](https://t.me/tactlang/34098)

[2024-06-27T16:54:41] **Illia Malovanyi**: That's great, but Tact is yet to support the feature that will automatically infer that the result is not null.

You cannot access any properties on the null object

[2024-06-27T12:42:59] **Illia Malovanyi**: i don't see how you add/subtract stakes tokens; based on this code, you just record the amount transfered (that's doesn't sound like staking)

one possibility is that you don't have enough gas coming with you notification to execute your complex hendler

try logging the contract in the tests with with https://www.npmjs.com/package/@henchtab/shrek

it will show you -14 exit code if you try to send jetton in your tests with specifying the sender


There're 2 options you can do;

the first one is to set higher forward_ton_amount

https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#:~:text=forward_ton_amount%20%2D%20the%20amount%20of%20nanotons%20to%20be%20sent%20to%20the%20destination%20address.

that's the value in toncoins that comes with your notification


the second one is to call nativeAcceptMessage(); you have to write a binding from FunC's stdlib for this one,

https://github.com/dreamqip/nenuma/blob/f2ec7c03fcb1f365234e4db7ff702a7487a5b925/packages/contracts/contracts/subscriber.tact#L3

That's how i did it in nenuma

if you call this function after authorizing that the sender is the right contract, then your contract will pay for this transfer from its balance

[2024-06-27T12:21:39] **Aish U**: Hi everyone,
Is it possible to write test cases using blue print for a set of asynchronous transactions?

Here is the scenario,

There is contract A and a user 1.
The user 1 makes a transaction to contract A and which makes further transcations in response. 
Here is the txn flow:

1 -> A -> B ->C -> A

Is it possible to create test cases using blueprint for the entire transaction flow( as the transactions are asynchronous), like if a transaction at C bounces, can we know it from blueprint test cases?  [#34053](https://t.me/tactlang/34053)
[2024-06-27T12:19:39] **Illia Malovanyi**: added new readme; if there are any suggestions on features, please let me know

[2024-06-26T21:10:34] **Illia Malovanyi**: The process of estimating fees for external messages should be the same as for internal messages.

I have a great example of how to calculate fees for transferring and burning jettons.

https://verifier.ton.org/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs#:~:text=()%20check_amount_is_enough_to_transfer(,))%3B%0A%7D

That's the source code of the USDT contract on the TON Blockchain. You can write such functions in FunC and then bridge them into Tact.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [33964](https://t.me/tactlang/33964)) [#33977](https://t.me/tactlang/33977)
[2024-06-26T21:02:14] **Illia Malovanyi**: The answer to your question very much depends on the length of your string.

Fift (the language for manipulating the TVM stack; Tact compiles into FunC and Func compiles into Fift) uses UFT-8 for strings. It means that each character can be 8 bits (1 byte), 16 bits (2 bytes), 24 bits (3 bytes), or 32 bits (4 bytes). Chinese characters require more than 1 byte to store.

Therefore, a string 'Hello, World!' takes 13 bytes or 13 * 8 = 104 bits. That's how much storage you need. 

The function sha256 in Tact calls the SHA256U opcode under the hood. It returns a 256-bit unsigned integer x.

https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions#:~:text=F902-,SHA256U,-s%20%2D%20x

Therefore, if your string size is <= 256 bits, that's reasonable to store the value as a string. But, if it's longer than that, it's better to use sha256 as you only need to check if the strings match. Obviously, you won't be able to restore the original value from such a hash.

I have to double-check that you pay fees just for the bits you use or for the number of cells you use. Could anyone elaborate on that and supply a relevant link to the documentation?

If you pay just for the number of bits you use, then the limits are the same as I described above. If you pay for the number of cells, then it's reasonable to use sha256 if you have a string that takes more then 1023 bits.

[2024-06-26T19:15:54] **Illia Malovanyi**: Yes, exactly. I've written a custom logger (shrek-logger)

It's inside utils.ts at the nenuma repository.

It shows the exit code as a number. If I get some errors, I then just go to the code and can precisely track what's the problem.

If I have a hashed string, that's quite not intuitive.

I create constants that represent error codes so that it's also easy for me to navigate around the code.

However, it also adds lots of boilerplate. Unfortunately, there's no way to export constants yet (or I just haven't found them in the exports).  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [33946](https://t.me/tactlang/33946)) [#33947](https://t.me/tactlang/33947)

[2024-06-24T01:20:13] **Illia Malovanyi**: Welcome, Rashid!

It's difficult to answer your question because it contains 'is going to be'. I'm sure it will substitute FunC completely one day. But it's yet to happen. For building proofs of concept, it's already great. My development time decreased a lot (I reckon it increased at least 4 times). I would spend like 2 months rather than 2 weeks on what I have built now. If you need to use FunC, you can simply call FunC code from Tact using native functions. Therefore, the answer to your question depends on what you want to build. If something is 0-to-1 and maybe beyond, Tact is already preferred. If you require aggressive optimizations and complex engineering, then I would prefer FunC today, but, as Tact gets better, I will switch to Tact.

Well, now, I will address the next question. As of now, Tact compiles directly into FunC. Therefore, if FunC can do something, you can do it Tact. You may even write some custom code in FunC and call it from Tact üëÄ As long as Tact is compliable into FunC, you will have no trouble. But in the future, Tact is going to be compiled directly into Fift (that's the language for manipulating the TVM stack like the Forth programming language). I think, once this milestone is achieved, the developers of Tact will make sure that Tact can do the same spectre of tasks as FunC.

[2024-06-24T01:04:41] **Illia Malovanyi**: Wow, that's great news! Thanks for your quick response to my issue. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to produce the example for your earlier, but it seems like you managed to do that by yourself.

[2024-06-24T00:47:41] **Rashid | McMoodoo**: Howdy! Thrilled to join such a community and the first question is:
- Going forward, is Tact going to be a preferred way to develop Smart Contracts on TON?
- Is there anything Tact won't be able to do that I will have to use FunC for?

Thanks  [#33670](https://t.me/tactlang/33670)

Func compilation error: /home/pantemon/nenuma/packages/contracts/build/Brokerage/tact_Broker.headers.fc:190:209: error: formal parameter name expected instead of `type`
  ... n_expiration_type_investment_payout(slice holder, slice writer, int initiation, int expiration, int type, int investment, int payout) inline;

Does it mean that type is a reserved word in Tact?

I've built a contract that accepts the Agreement struct with the type field. It works fine in the testnet. 

But now I'm trying to instantiate an object of that struct in the contract and I'm simply getting pissed off by the compiler.

UPD. I've just refactored all my code that there's no type field anymore. As a result, I have no errors.

If that's a reserved word, then cool, but we need to make sure that the user is not limited inside structs, or, at least show this error earlier, when the first compilation takes place. I've also never seen any type parameter in FunC. Is it some extra from Tact?  [#33563](https://t.me/tactlang/33563)

[2024-06-19T18:42:17] **Tom - Bushi**: what is more gas efficient:
1. making a local variable let vari:Int = X * Y; and then using it in two or 3 places or

[2024-06-19T18:16:25] **Vitor Py**: "forward_payload" replaces the transferFrom mechanics, indirectly.

        seller: Address;
        owner : Address;

[2024-06-18T13:52:45] **Stuart**: i feel like this could be much more like an RPC call / function call while still informing the developer that its a message going out  [#33078](https://t.me/tactlang/33078)
[2024-06-18T13:52:26] **Stuart**: like send(sendParameters())  [#33077](https://t.me/tactlang/33077)

If you build your contract and then explore its code, you can find the following:

slice $broker = $global_contractAddress(($brokerStateInit'code, $brokerStateInit'data));

this is what contractAddress compiles for.

initOf is compiled into:

var ($brokerStateInit'code, $brokerStateInit'data) = $Broker$_init_child(__tact_context_sys, my_address(), $response'stream);

[2024-06-17T13:44:57] **Illia Malovanyi**: Can you elaborate on that? As far as I am concerned no event can execute some code after each received message. If you're focused on receivers, then you can write a wrapper around the send function so that it executes some action every time you send a message  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [32714](https://t.me/tactlang/32714)) [#32735](https://t.me/tactlang/32735)
[2024-06-17T13:43:16] **Illia Malovanyi**: Do you have a bug with that?

It should not work as you describe, to my knowledge. That's because you compute what to send when your dictionary still has data that you delete later. The action is sent later, but what to send is calculated before you delete the data.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [32702](https://t.me/tactlang/32702)) [#32733](https://t.me/tactlang/32733)

[2024-06-17T12:28:26] **Illia Malovanyi**: There are different stages when executing contracts with TVM.

Some of them are the compute phase and the action phase.

In your code, when it's executed, it's in the compute phase. The action of sending a message is recorded in the c5 register containing actions. Then you delete something from the contract dictionary and decrement its length.

The action itself is sent after the compute phase, hence it's sent after you update your storage.

However, if you will be sending 2 messages where each message has the mode SendRemainingBalance, then the first message will send all the remaining balance and the second one will just send 0 (because you have already decided to send all the remaining balance with the first message)

There are more info on TVM phases on the following page:

[2024-06-16T11:10:45] **Creator**: You probably import contract wrapper from another dir.
When we write contracts in Tact, when compiled, they are linked to the code of the contracts that we use.
If you use this approach, then you need to import contracts from the same compiled folder.
But if you want to use token contracts without being tied to the token code, and for example use jUSDT tokens, you can consider requesting the token address from the master contract in your contract. I did it like this:




send(SendParameters{
            to: self.jetton_master, // sending message back to the sender
            value: simple_message_request, 
            body: ProvideWalletAddress{
                query_id: 0,
                owner_address: myAddress(),
                include_address: false,
            }.toCell(),
        });


And do receiver like this:


receive(msg: TakeWalletAddress) {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        if (ctx.sender == self.jetton_master) {
            self.jetton_wallet = msg.wallet_address;
    }  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [32416](https://t.me/tactlang/32416)) [#32419](https://t.me/tactlang/32419)

[2024-06-16T10:22:06] **Quillen**: Hi everyone,
I've a trouble when get Jetton contract wallet address inside the smart contract.
I'm using the Jetton contract from this source: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard, and I'm trying to get the Jetton wallet address from my contract. Here are the details:

In my contract, I get the wallet address with this code:


let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(msg.jettonAddress, myAddress());
let contractWallet: Address = contractAddress(init);
dump("Master: ");
dump(msg.jettonAddress);
dump("Owner: ");
dump(myAddress());
dump("contractWallet: ");
dump(contractWallet);

However, when I read the data from the Jetton address, I get a different contract wallet, even though I use the same input for Master and Owner addresses:


virtual fun getJettonWalletInit(address: Address): StateInit {
    let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address);
    let contractWallet: Address = contractAddress(init);
    dump("Master: ");
    dump(myAddress());
    dump("Owner: ");
    dump(address);
    dump("contractWallet: ");
    dump(contractWallet);

    return initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address);
}


You can find more details and reproduce the issue by running the tests here: https://github.com/quocle108/ton-tact-test. Below is the test debug output:

[2024-06-14T18:36:51] **Dmitry M1s5**: is there a formatter for tact?  [#32038](https://t.me/tactlang/32038)
[2024-06-14T18:34:48] **Anton Trunov**: @D_M1s5 btw, I opened an issue about throw that you mentioned before https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/421  [#32036](https://t.me/tactlang/32036)
[2024-06-14T18:33:38] **Anton Trunov**: otherwise we are going to have a huge language with too many special cases supported  [#32035](https://t.me/tactlang/32035)
[2024-06-14T18:33:14] **Anton Trunov**: if it can be done in the language and does not incur too much performance penalty then it should be done on the user side  [#32034](https://t.me/tactlang/32034)
[2024-06-14T18:32:33] **Anton Trunov**: sure, this is what programming languages are for, to encode and enforce your own rules  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [32031](https://t.me/tactlang/32031)) [#32033](https://t.me/tactlang/32033)

[2024-06-14T18:31:02] **Dmitry M1s5**: create a runtime check before every function call or smth

it can be suboptimal, but if one wants such a behaviour, he will be doing it ad hoc anyway  [#32031](https://t.me/tactlang/32031)
[2024-06-14T18:30:30] **Dmitry M1s5**: but runtime checks is still a thing  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [32027](https://t.me/tactlang/32027)) [#32030](https://t.me/tactlang/32030)
[2024-06-14T18:29:45] **Anton Trunov**: nope, fun doSmth(x: Int as uint8) {} does not really make sense, because functions get their arguments from the TVM stack and all integers there are 257-bit ones  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [32025](https://t.me/tactlang/32025)) [#32027](https://t.me/tactlang/32027)
[2024-06-14T18:24:32] **Dmitry M1s5**: is it a bad idea to have dedicated structs/messages for each function to enforce bit length of ints?

fun doSmth(args: DoSmthArgs): DoSmthRetVal {}




Is there a plan for making args typed with formats?

[2024-06-14T17:44:00] **Nerses**: i have a problem with parsing message. What to do if i get long string with api and dont know in what type of variable to store it (as it overflows) to load data from it bit by bit ? any hints or approaches ?  [#32006](https://t.me/tactlang/32006)
[2024-06-14T17:36:29] **Anton Trunov**: check out Tact docs, our cookbook: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/data-structures#array  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [31937](https://t.me/tactlang/31937)) [#32001](https://t.me/tactlang/32001)
[2024-06-14T17:35:10] **Anton Trunov**: as of Tact v1.3 the traversed map needs to be a simple identifier like foo, so self.contracts is not going to work.

you can do

let c: map<‚Ä¶> = self.contracts;
foreach (k, v in c) {
 ‚Ä¶
}
as a workaround.

We will lift this restriction in the next Tact release. Hopefully next week  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [31935](https://t.me/tactlang/31935)) [#32000](https://t.me/tactlang/32000)

[2024-06-13T13:30:34] **Aish U**: Thank you. 
But if you have some 7 interactions in between and got bounced due to some other reasons, at that time whatever that was passed as value(gas) will get stucked in the immediate caller right, it wil not be given back to the user who initiated it. Right

So the user will loose the extra TON. 
Is there something that can be done , so users wont loose the extra TON?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [31547](https://t.me/tactlang/31547)) [#31560](https://t.me/tactlang/31560)

[2024-06-10T12:39:28] **Ken M**: that's the definition of "optimization". If trivial changes in code result in different assembly code, then it means the compiler failed to properly optimize one of the two versions.

[2024-06-10T12:37:49] **Behrang Norouzinia**: I don't think that gas usage is any problem here. Ton fees are already low enough. 

These optimization that you talk about, might only matter in competition between differet protocols. 

And in that case, you still have options.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30728](https://t.me/tactlang/30728)) [#30729](https://t.me/tactlang/30729)
[2024-06-10T12:34:36] **Ken M**: The FunC compiler does a literal translation to Fift in most cases, and even trivial changes such as the order that you do multiple assignments can change the gas usage.  [#30728](https://t.me/tactlang/30728)
[2024-06-10T12:31:20] **Behrang Norouzinia**: No, I disagree. I would say that with some syntax similarities like Ruby, it is a little easier than C.

It also has good enough optimizations. For more optimizations you can use Fift inside FunC, like writiing Assembly inside C.

[2024-06-10T11:46:00] **Illia Malovanyi**: Depending on your requirements. The easiest way to start is, obviously, Tact. It has good docs, familiar syntaxes and auto-generates wrappers to interact with contracts. However, if you have some specific requests, such as update, that Tact doesn't support yet, or you want to optimize your contract aggressively, then it's probably still FunC.

Tact is like C, but FunC is like Assembly (it's not entirely correct comparison, but effective as it shows the difference from the developer experience point of view)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30695](https://t.me/tactlang/30695)) [#30707](https://t.me/tactlang/30707)
[2024-06-10T11:42:10] **Illia Malovanyi**: I don't think I have some code for Tact, but the idea behind is the same as for wallet contracts.

This is the simplest wallet on TON (V1)

https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/wallet-code.fc

You can see that on the line 13, the public key is loaded from get data with seqno.

It's stored with contract init 

So you can add init(publicKey: slice) 

Then you can modify the deploy message so it sends the correct initial value for your contract.

Deploy { queryId, value }

You will need to remove Deployable trait

Then you receive deploy message, init everything completely, and then just do self.notify DeployOk

I hope you manage implement this. If you struggle, I can help you with the code later today  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30702](https://t.me/tactlang/30702)) [#30706](https://t.me/tactlang/30706)

[2024-06-10T11:30:01] **Illia Malovanyi**: No way to deploy though an existing mnemonic. 

Your init must take your public key, in this way, it's derived using your mnemonics. Then you can modify the deploy receiver and provide initial values for your init. 

Your current contract address is derived from some initial value you provide (your data) and the code of your contract. There is no link to you public key and, therefore, your mnemonics  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30685](https://t.me/tactlang/30685)) [#30701](https://t.me/tactlang/30701)

do i need to create some sort of dict with queries map<CellHash, MessageCell> to store all outcoming requests and then rollback if I get the message back?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30538](https://t.me/tactlang/30538)) [#30549](https://t.me/tactlang/30549)

[2024-06-08T20:36:45] **Illia Malovanyi**: there is no easy solution because the jetton wallet address is derived  from (jetton_master + holder)

to notify everyone you either need to have a huge map (which is strongly not recommended and is a very bad idea as it doesn't scale)

but this can be a good idea if you have up  to 250 elements, I guess, I still try to figure out how gas is calculated for mappings

you can also try to create something like 'channel' contract which deploys subscriptions from (channel address + subscription id = 0) but deriving address costs ~0.005 TON for single contract + transfer 0.005 approximately

so to message 1000 holders it will cost 10 tons

there easiest way is to make jetton holders claim their tokens by themselves, so you create such contract and then other people just send a message to claim their tokens  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30239](https://t.me/tactlang/30239)) [#30249](https://t.me/tactlang/30249)

[2024-06-08T14:37:14] **Anton Trunov**: üöÄ Tact v1.3 release notes

The new Tact v1.3 release provides a massive improvement on the smart contract programming for TON blockchain.

üó∫ Maps

Traversing a map has never been easier! The foreach loop for the Map type:

let mapLength: Int = 0;
foreach (k, v in map) {
  mapLength += 1;
}


You don't have to use map.set(key, null) to remove a key from your maps, use the more intuitive del method instead: map.del(key).

Want to check if the map is empty? Use map.isEmpty()!

üî§ Strings 

Strings finally support escape sequences, like \\, \", \n, \u0000 through \uFFFF, etc.

There is a new non-modifying StringBuilder's concat method for chained string concatenations: b = b.concat("Hello,").concat(foo).concat("Tact!").

We added the toString method for the Address type that you asked for numerous times in the dev chats: address("EQBKgXCNLPexWhs2L79kiARR1phGH1LwXxRbNsCFF9doc2lN").toString().

üëå Handling exceptions

Want to process various TVM and user-defined exit codes before your contract fails at runtime? The try and try-catch statements: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/statements#try-catch:


try {
    let foo: Int = 42 / 0;
} catch(e) {
    // your division by zero handler
}


‚òÄÔ∏è New quality-of-life improving syntax

Tact started supporting struct fields punning, i.e. {foo, bar} is syntactic sugar for { foo: foo, bar: bar }.

There is support for trailing commas in all comma-separated lists in Tact, here is how you can use it with structs:
  
  foo(Struct {
    field1: 42,
    field2: "42",
  })
  

You can now chain method calls with the unboxing operator !!, e.g. map.asCell()!!.hash().

For those missing some bit-level hackery, there is the bitwise XOR operator ^ available now.

‚öôÔ∏è Stdlib enhancements 

The Tact team has added log2 and log, pow2 and pow functions.

Use reserve mode constants from @stdlib/reserve instead of their numeric values to make your code even easier to read: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve-base-modes.

üß† Debugging

Debugging has become easier now as the dump() and dumpStack() functions now print the file path, line number, and column number in addition to the data specified by the programmer.

Addresses can be arguments of the dump function.

üíª Tact CLI

Tact's command line interface just became a lot more user-friendly: run npx tact --help from terminal and see what's available.

Just a highlight: CLI now allows compiling a single Tact file directly, without specifying a config file: npx tact your-awesome-contract.tact. It's very useful for quick experiments or bug reports.

üõ† Third-party tools support 

For third-party tools implementors there is new improved APIs: AST traversals, access to the AST store of top-level items like functions, constants, traits, etc.

Happy hacking! ‚ù§Ô∏è

[2024-06-08T06:02:19] **Illia Malovanyi**: As far as I am concerned, there is no way to decode the BoC without knowing its TL-B. TL-B is a schema of the message. It's like protobuf. BoC is binary data and it can be literally anything.

Well, you may try to brute-force all possible combinations of what the original message could look like and see if the decoded data makes any sense. But I don't think that you're interested in decoding a single BoC.  

Therefore the answer is that there is no way to decode BoC without its TL-B. Please feel free to correct me if my reasoning is somewhere wrong.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30034](https://t.me/tactlang/30034)) [#30049](https://t.me/tactlang/30049)
[2024-06-08T05:55:12] **Illia Malovanyi**: The address of your wallet is derived from your public key and the wallet's code. It means that if you change your wallet's code, you will have it deployed under a different address.

This can be illustrated using the following equation: public key + code = wallet address

Hence

public key + code v3r2 = wallet address v3r2 

public key + code v3r3 = wallet address v3r3

Therefore, when you change your wallet version, you change your wallet's code and hence have your NFT deployed to a completely different address!  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [30026](https://t.me/tactlang/30026)) [#30047](https://t.me/tactlang/30047)

[2024-06-04T20:22:11] **Vasily**: Hey guys!
Maybe someone here can give me a clue =)
My team is developing a Traction Eye service where a user can analyse not only tokens but also the DeFi protocols he uses.

We have a technical question from the backend side:
1)Is it possible to get the data of protocols used by a particular wallet: 
- Liquid pools (Dedust, StonFi)
- Lending protocol (EVAA) 
- Staking providers (Bemo, Stakers, Stakee, etc).
How can this be implemented?
To make it clearer what data we are talking about, you can see the mockup.  [#29152](https://t.me/tactlang/29152)

[2024-06-04T20:19:49] **K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†**: I guess, your main concern should be storage fee. As for gas, you probably should estimate it based on the current length of the map.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [29132](https://t.me/tactlang/29132)) [#29150](https://t.me/tactlang/29150)

If i do same for nft collection data then it is working fine, but while creting nft i'm facing such issue, please help me here

Also if i modify Mint message in contract in such way that it can receive some integer value or data type then it is also working good, but only when I try to use String then i am facing issue.  [#28740](https://t.me/tactlang/28740)

I need some advice. I'm learning Tact and trying to build a smart contract that can accept USDT from one address, hold it for a while, and then send it to another address. I know how to send TON, but I'm not sure how to send USDT on the TON blockchain.

I found USDT Asset Processing on TON, but I'm still confused. Can someone explain the steps I need to take and where to look for information? Is it possible to do this with just Tact?

The goal is for a user to log in with TON Connect, send USDT to another user (who also connects with TON Connect), and after some time, the sender sends another transaction to release the funds to the receiver.

[2024-05-27T12:19:20] **Tom - Bushi**: hey guys, I have a question about gas usage and error handling. 

Say I got some complex logic with many contracts user -> contractA -> contractB -> C -> D and I get an error or lack of permission in contract D. I would like to roll back the changes made in the previous contracts, but as I understand it that would also take gas right? But from what I understand, if I run out of gas at some point, the logic just stops at the point where there was no more gas. 

So potentially it could stop mid change reversal in contractB and leave the changes in contract A inTact (pun semi-intended). 

How is stuff like this handled? Should the user just be sending enough gas to cover all potential routes of logic?  [#27539](https://t.me/tactlang/27539)

[2024-05-24T12:22:14] **Aleksandr Tuchkov**: Scaling. The problem with EVM model is the atomic transaction nature. You either do everything in single transaction, or you cannot do it at all. It is somewhat like having one enourmous database with everything on single machine vs splitting that database into shards. System complexity in TON model is definitely higher, but it is scalable.

I have a question, maybe someone knows the answer or at least where to dig. I'm using the contract to manage Jettons on his own wallet. In the contract code I get its address:


let init: StateInit = initOf TokenWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);


But of course I want to use the code of some popular tokens, like USDT.
How can I put code here when compiling a contract, for example this wallet https://tonviewer.com/EQDmVdCZ2SALvyfCDVlPLr0hoPhUxgjNFtTAxemz9V_C5wbN?section=code

[2024-05-21T15:42:34] **Creator**: Hi everyone. 
This is a question, maybe you know the reason for this awkward situation.

Im trying to create contract, which  must manage jettons on JettonDefaultWallet. I use the default JettonDefaultWallet and JettonMaster.

But in the contract it gives a different result than when I ask JettonMastera for the JettonVolet address at the my contract address. I thought this was in a test environment. But it‚Äôs the same on the testnet. And everything seems to be according 
to the manual.


let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);
        let wallet_address: Address = contractAddress(init);

}



And it turns out that the only way out is to transfer the init + data code for the flight token manually after deployment. But this is kind of an ugly solution. Perhaps you know what the problem is in the story now.

randomInt (from tact) - generates random number
randomize_lt (from func) - set random seed for random generator with current logical time (equivalent to randomize(cur_lt()))

Basically,
nativeRandomizeLt (from tact) is equivalent to randomize_lt (from func)
randomInt (from tact) is equivalent to random (from func)

and under the hood it uses native func functions:

Help please. Cant move on. Can give a few TON reward for helping. 

Intro:
1) I created a custom contract something like JobOffer. It should has own JettonWallet and manage jettons based on its state.

2) I created test environment but could not test because of here is dificulty for JettonWallet addresses, JettonWallets states and so on..II think I'm blind and I'm missing something important or making a base mistake

[2024-05-15T10:53:38] **Creator**: Hi everyone. Question about testing contracts. I need to emulate blockchain environment and test interaction between different contracts; 
What another approach I can explore for testing this functionality?
Because I met the problem:

token = blockchain.openContract(await TokenMaster.fromInit(deployer.address, content));
        await token.send(
                deployer.getSender(),
                {
                    value: deployAmount,
                },
                "Mint: 100"
            )
        deployerJW = blockchain.openContract(
            await TokenWallet.fromInit(deployer.address, token.address) 
        )
        log(deployerJW.address, "deployer JW address") 
        // EQBko2AxduHfkugtASrwt8PpgrRF219f5bfF7KSnvyqM-r_B
        log(await token.getGetWalletAddress(deployer.address), "Deployer JW from master")
        // EQAL5bi5NXRHq3HRBZkSFun8kWPHT9J7OE3LNebt8WgWefzi
        log(token.address, "Token Address")
        // EQDy5DDBz9DtUT7m93oBE-NJN9WAwz_0JDVrQhGaUaDhtXRb
        await deployerJW.send(
            deployer.getSender(),
            {
                value: toNano(10)
            },
            {
                $$type: "Deploy",
                queryId: 1n
            }
        )
        log(await deployerJW.getGetWalletData())

        // my custom contract has the same type of JettonWallet and I wanna manage jettons.
        // I don`t know why, but it too calculated another fun jetton_wallet_address(): Address {
        // let init: StateInit = initOf TokenWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);
        // let wallet_address: Address = contractAddress(init);  [#25737](https://t.me/tactlang/25737)

[2024-05-14T16:38:15] **Denis Baturin**: I've encountered the same problem. There seems to be a bug that generates the interfaces for imported contracts with a bit different sorting order when you code is generated for different contracts. And then this interfaces with different sorting are hashed to construct the IPFS link and that link get's embedded into your contracts source code (! that's a very bad thing it's not on demand). And that's what makes the source code and thus the resulting addresses differ.

Unfortunately I have no solution, we've finished our prototype with a workaround and are done with Tact for now.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [25637](https://t.me/tactlang/25637)) [#25642](https://t.me/tactlang/25642)

Who can help me?)

Im trying to send message to JettonWallet of my contract. Before this I sent some amount of Jettons there from another wallet. But something wrong and after 'revoke' self.state is in OfferClosed state, but JettonWallet of this contract is still has jettons. 


```     
     receive("revoke") {
        require(self.owner == sender(), "Offer could be revoked only by poster.");
        require(self.state == OfferPublished, "Cant revoke job. ");
        self.send_deposit(self.owner, self.price);
        self.state = OfferClosed;
    }

    fun send_deposit(address: Address, amount: Int) {
        let init: StateInit = initOf TokenWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);  
        let my_jetton_address: Address = contractAddress(init);
        let forward_destination: Int = ton("0.91");
        send(SendParameters{
            to: my_jetton_address, 
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue, 
            bounce: false,
            body: Transfer{ // 0x0f817ea5
                query_id: 0,
                amount: amount,
                destination: address,
                response_destination: address,
                custom_payload: beginCell().endCell(),
                forward_ton_amount: forward_destination,
                forward_payload: beginCell().endCell().asSlice(),
            }.toCell(),
            code: init.code,
            data: init.data
        });
```
Here is peace of tests:

// revoke
        let res = await jobOffer.send(
            poster.getSender(),
            {
                value: toNano(1.64)
            },
            "revoke"
        )
        JOData = await jobOffer.getJobData()
        assert(JOData.state == 6n) // passed
        
        poster_data = await posterJettonWallet.getGetWalletData()
        log(fromNano(poster_data.balance), "Poster balance after revoke") //did not changed

        OfferContractData = await jobOfferJettonWallet.getGetWalletData()

1) For example, why in jetton.tack#L211 such a balance check, we use safeMath by default, so it should be replaced with require(self.balance >= msg.amount, "Invalid amount");
 before subtraction.

2) Why is response_destination of type address?, although in TEP-74 this parameter is set explicitly. Should it be address and may have value address(0,0)?

3) Why don't we use mode: SendBounceIfActionFail in burn/mint receivers, since we don't have gas checks there?

[2024-05-10T10:41:10] **Pavel**: The difference between bounce: true and mode: SendBounceIfActionFail is that in first case it bounces if contract can't receive this type of message or contract doesn't exist and in second case it bounces if revert occurs during action?

If bounce set to true and contract revert during action, than this won't bounce without this mode?  [#25018](https://t.me/tactlang/25018)
[2024-05-10T10:36:41] **Daniil Sedov**: all contracts must pay fees for storing data on-chain.
if your contract stops paying these fees (for example, you withdraw all its balance), it'll become frozen after some time, and if it's frozen for long enough, it'll get deleted from blockchain completely.

transaction history could still be visible, though, but there are no guarantees that it will be visible forever.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [25001](https://t.me/tactlang/25001)) [#25017](https://t.me/tactlang/25017)

[2024-05-10T08:15:57] **Jay Tai**: First we calculate the user jetton wallet address by passing in the jetton master wallet address. Can refer to this script.
    const jettonMaster = client4.open(JettonMaster.create(Address.parse(JETTON_MASTER_ADDRESS)));
    const TARGET_ADDRESS = await jettonMaster.getWalletAddress(USER_ADDRESS);


Then TARGET_ADDRESS is the user jetton wallet address right, we can send an instruction to it to send X amount of jetton to contract. See below.
    let packed_msg = beginCell()
        .storeUint(0x0f8a7ea5, 32)
        .storeUint(0, 64)
        .storeCoins(toNano(7)) //number of jetton to be sent
        .storeAddress(Address.parse(SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)) //send to where? the contract address
        .storeAddress(USER_ADDRESS) //when done, response to where
        .storeUint(0, 1)
        .storeCoins(toNano("0.4")) // forward amount
        .endCell();


Then finally we trigger the sending
            internal({
                to: TARGET_ADDRESS,
                value: toNano("0.5"),
                body: packed_msg,

I need to link a Jetton to a contract and be able to manage them through it, essentially creating a sort of buffer for the transaction (send, store, hold until the owner unlocks).

[2024-04-24T12:59:57] **Spetsnaz**: I couldn't find any documentation on how to take fees from the context value. For example, the contract will charge 1 TON for a certain service.

- SendRemainingValue will just return all the tons minus the blockchain fees
- Using send() means that it's going to essentially "refund" in a different message, so the person would "receive" Tons as if it's a new transaction to them

Anyway to do this without option 2, where we just deduct the 1 TON from the value and SendRemainingValue?  [#22609](https://t.me/tactlang/22609)

[2024-04-23T13:10:14] **Spetsnaz**: Nope. Unless you use special Jetton wallets that you create which communicate with FooContract directly. The other way around is to use an API and update the balance on your contract using this api. You can look at tonapi.io  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [22412](https://t.me/tactlang/22412)) [#22413](https://t.me/tactlang/22413)

[2024-04-23T13:07:16] **Spetsnaz**: If you look at the standard Jetton wallet, you‚Äôll see that it initializes a new contract for each address  [#22409](https://t.me/tactlang/22409)
[2024-04-23T13:06:33] **Spetsnaz**: Jettons on TON need their own wallet. It‚Äôs not EVM. Logic as follow:
WalletA owns JettonA via WalletAA (which is created automatically)

When you send to FooContract, which is your  contract, JettonA creates a JettonA wallet (new contract) that has as owner FooContract. So your contract never really stores Jettons, it‚Äôs being assigned new wallets for their respective jettons  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [22401](https://t.me/tactlang/22401)) [#22408](https://t.me/tactlang/22408)

[2024-04-22T05:37:51] **Yakitori**: Humm I don't think so - usually a nonce will be used for the user endpoint (his wallet for instance), so unless he sends 2 transactions with the same nonce at the same time there wouldn't be a problem?

[2024-04-22T05:34:24] **Yakitori**: And if the transaction is valid, update the counter  [#22156](https://t.me/tactlang/22156)
[2024-04-22T05:33:46] **Yakitori**: If the nonce is lower or equal to the current nonce, you revert  [#22155](https://t.me/tactlang/22155)
[2024-04-22T05:33:34] **Diego**: I guess i should get the next id from a getter function and add this id to the message im going to send and then check it  [#22154](https://t.me/tactlang/22154)
[2024-04-22T05:33:29] **Yakitori**: You can add a counter held in the state of the contract, and when you pass a transaction you need to give a nonce.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [22152](https://t.me/tactlang/22152)) [#22153](https://t.me/tactlang/22153)

[2024-04-22T05:30:06] **Yakitori**: So you can't replay an old transaction with a lower nonce  [#22150](https://t.me/tactlang/22150)
[2024-04-22T05:29:53] **Yakitori**: Just like with Ethereum, each transaction has a nonce number that increases with each transaction  [#22149](https://t.me/tactlang/22149)

[2024-04-22T05:28:55] **Diego**: a nonce is a seqno? or is it something different?  [#22146](https://t.me/tactlang/22146)
[2024-04-22T05:28:20] **Yakitori**: It's mainly with Jetton wallets, usually setting a nonce is sufficient I think?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [22142](https://t.me/tactlang/22142)) [#22145](https://t.me/tactlang/22145)

What about querying Jettons which are outside of my control? I would like to know the balance of a certain Jetton (which I have the address of) from my contract in the sender‚Äôs wallet.

Any way to query standard Jettons asynchronously to get the balance?  [#21930](https://t.me/tactlang/21930)

So in my buy function, I am running into quite alot of issues when trying to send TON to someone.


receive(msg: Buy) {
    let price: Int = self.calculatePrice(self.totalSupply, msg.amount);
    let shareFee: Int = price * self.shareFeePercent / 100;
    let forwardFee: Int = context.readForwardFee();
    require(context().value >= price + shareFee + forwardFee, "Not enough value");
    
    // send funds code, see below
    // ...
    // send funds code, see below

    self.mint(...);
}


I'm unsure what parameters I should be putting here, as using SendPayGasSeparately always fails my transaction. 


// A
send(SendParameters{
    to: self.owner,
    value: shareFee,
    bounce: false,
    body: SendShareFeeSuccess{ amount: shareFee }.toCell(),
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendPayGasSeparately
});
// B
send(SendParameters{
    to: self.owner,
    value: shareFee + forwardFee,
    bounce: false,
    body: SendShareFeeSuccess{ amount: shareFee }.toCell(),
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors

[2024-04-14T16:27:46] **Ken M**: So the definitions are:
var_uint$_ {n:#} len:(#< n) value:(uint (len * 8))
         = VarUInteger n;
#< x - Nat less than x bit unsigned integer stored as lenBits(x - 1) bits, up to 31 bits

[2024-04-12T14:18:18] **Nerses**: Hello everyone! I'm delving into Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) and their implementation possibilities within blockchain frameworks. HTLCs are key for enabling secure, conditional, and time-bound transactions, making them essential for things like cross-chain trades and other trustless protocols. I'm particularly curious about implementations in the Tact language. Does anyone here have experience with HTLCs in Tact, or know of any resources or examples? Any guidance or examples you could provide would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!  [#20422](https://t.me/tactlang/20422)

How to add a text postscript when transferring money with Jetton? I tried following the writing method in the document and it still showed up in the browser.

[2024-04-09T21:48:53] **Anton Trunov**: Tact does not support tuple types like (Int, Int) yet, so you need to declare a structure with two integer fields and make it the return type of derivePubKey  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [20028](https://t.me/tactlang/20028)) [#20042](https://t.me/tactlang/20042)
[2024-04-09T20:10:29] **Alexander Osipov**: Guys I have a crypto.fc file with method:
(int,int) derivePubKey(int privKey) inline_ref {
  return curve_math::derivePubKey(privKey);
}

I'm trying to import and declare it in tact file:
import "./imports/crypto.fc";

@name(derivePubKey)
native derivePubKey(privKey: Int): (Int,Int);

But I'm getting error on compilation: 
Error: /home/kazrez/projects/ton/nft-contract/contracts/example_contract.tact:4:36: Syntax error: expected "bounced", "map", or "A".."Z" 
Line 4, col 36:

[2024-04-05T13:12:40] **Blockchain Dev**: Well, probably TON doesn't able to work with more than a single call with a single transaction. I've split calls to separate functions and it became a solution  [#19403](https://t.me/tactlang/19403)
[2024-04-05T12:29:50] **Blockchain Dev**: I've got a new bug. I'm testing child creation with for() statement and every 3 or 4 call doesn't set owner address to child contract. I checked events and realized that when I'm doing call to the parent's function that makes a couple of calls to a child contract second call doesn't happen every 3 or 4 times. It looks like it is a bug of TON emulator  [#19399](https://t.me/tactlang/19399)
[2024-04-05T10:36:06] **Blockchain Dev**: BTW, somebody know could we get parent contract's address with TON itself? Something like address.parent  [#19391](https://t.me/tactlang/19391)

I am needing a little help with a very basic question.
I've deployed for the first time an smart contract, as a simple test I was using 03-send-coins sample from TACT site and added only 1 more receive with other parameters.
But when deployed in production I've sent 0.05 TON with Tonhub wallet and I got back 0.041841 TON.
Then I've sent to the contract again 0.05 but got back 0.046926 TON.

I am learning coding smart contracts (coming from mobile/web dev).

Im wondering is there a way to test smart contracts like in ‚Äúlearn by example ui‚Äù.  Coming from Web/Mobile I‚Äôm used to deploy/test in real device workflow.

I was thinking to just clone that repo and modify smart contracts there. Is it the best way to start?

[2024-03-17T10:42:26] **Anton Trunov**: Let me put it this way: I‚Äôd say Tact is prototype-ready at this moment. It‚Äôs a great solution to create your MVP and encode the core of your business-logic in Tact, interfacing with some manually optimized FunC code when there is gas pressure. There is at least one serious project that utilizes this approach. The output FunC code that Tact produces can be suboptimal in many cases but this is to be expected since Tact is a more high-level language. The Tact team will be working on gas optimizations, though, as soon as we finish the features outlined in the Tact roadmap. You can checkout how these features and bugfixes are spread across different milestones here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/milestones. Our main priority are UX improvements and compiler correctness now. We are going to have Tact‚Äôs implementation checked by a top-notch software security audit firm and also we are building our own security-ensuring tools, like a compiler fuzzer: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/133.

[2024-03-16T07:37:26] **Jay Tai**: Agree on this. I feel the same when I first comes to FunC/Fift. It's a steep learning curve for me.

[2024-03-16T04:04:04] **Howard**: At this moment, Jetton Transfers may incur twice the gas cost in Tact.

However, there is certainly room for improvement. The higher-level language has more structured patterns, which should allow for optimization at the compiler level.

Although, as of now, Tact is more of a transpiler that helps you generate FunC code after you compile your Tact-lang code.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [16136](https://t.me/tactlang/16136)) [#16221](https://t.me/tactlang/16221)

I hope this type of message is allowed

I am looking for a dev who can write 3 smart contracts. Pls pm me - we can discuss it in more details  [#16200](https://t.me/tactlang/16200)
[2024-03-14T21:09:32] **Javier Rincon**: I dont think so, of course since tact is a simpler language, I guess people will make simpler things and store more stuff than needed. But it really depends on what kind of processing the language do in  the end. If a function from tact that compiles in func do 10 operations, and you can do the same with 4 operations in func, probably it will cost more. That would be the normal if you use a higher level language. Is like comparing C# against c++ or assembler. The lower the level of the language, the more optimized it is.

I am facing the following problem. During development I used blueprint framework, and I wrote some scripts to interact with contracts in Type Script. I would like to be able to run them from a program, for example to make a website, and on clicking a button - execute the script. I've run into the problem that I can't get a NetworkProvider. Are there any guides on how to do this? I would be very grateful

[2024-03-09T22:13:07] **Aydin Manzouri**: As I understand, TON contracts are supposed to be as compact as possible. Let me give a comparison.

In Ethereum, contracts have a "monolith" structure; that is, a single (possibly huge) contract can store a list of a myriad of items (tokens, NFTs, etc.) in itself. And when a new item is to be added to the list, a new transaction occurs, extending the size of the contract.

On the other hand, in TON the situation is completely different. TON blockchain works with the "actor model," and this is one the cornerstones of its infinite scalability. In this model, instead of a single giant contract, we have a composite structure of relatively small-sized contracts, consisting of a "parent" contract together with lots of "child" contracts, each of which storing a single item of the list as compared to the above monolithic Ethereum contract. And whenever a new item is to be added to the list, a message is sent to the parent contract which, in turn, generates a new child contract containing the newly added item. This way, infinite extendibility of the list of items is guaranteed in TON ecosystem.

Now, returning to your question, I would kindly recommend you to keep your contracts as compact as possible, and instead try to utilize the actor model of TON. I'm sure you will achieve better results this way.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [15831](https://t.me/tactlang/15831)) [#15844](https://t.me/tactlang/15844)

Is there a specific size limit for this BOC size? Currently, my code's BOC size can reach up to approximately 20197 bytes.

[2024-03-06T17:23:26] **Anton Trunov**: üöÄ Tact v1.2.0 Release Highlights 

New Tact v1.2.0 is now live with features requested by the community. 

‚Äî  Fresh assignment operators  +=,¬†-=,¬†*=,¬†/=¬†and¬†%=
‚Äî  Readability boost with underscores in large numbers: 1000000000 ¬ª¬ª  1_000_000_000
‚Äî  Added binary and octal literals: 0b1010_0101, 0o4242_0376 
‚Äî  Added support for ternary conditional operators let foo: Int = your_condition ? 42 : 0 .
‚Äî  The equality and non-equality operators (==¬†and¬†!=) now support slices and strings by comparing the hashes of the left-hand and right-hand sides.

Both the official VS Code plugin for Tact and tact.vim have been updated with the new features. 

Happy Coding!  [#15692](https://t.me/tactlang/15692)

[2024-03-03T18:32:01] **Spite Moriarty**: Not necessarily a contract, you can just create a file that imports two contracts, but still cyclic imports should be handled correctly, because creating 3 files for such a case is not a direct solution  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [15545](https://t.me/tactlang/15545)) [#15546](https://t.me/tactlang/15546)
[2024-03-03T18:30:06] **Aydin Manzouri**: Just as a raw idea to think of:

What about creating a 3rd contract C which then imports both A and B simultaneously?

Rationale. According to your description about cyclic imports, it seems that contracts A and B should look as peers of each other, with equal ranks in some hierarchy of contracts. So, a third contract C which to be of a higher hierarchy may handle both of them equally.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [15495](https://t.me/tactlang/15495)) [#15545](https://t.me/tactlang/15545)

[2024-02-26T08:52:31] **Yuri**: Hello guys, I'm importing a common contract into two different others, since I need addresses calculated given the InitData.
Though, I'm not getting the same address for both given the same InitData.
I investigated a little bit and found out that the generated FunC code for the same imported contract was different for each context in just one place, the IPFS link for the ABI.
Since the IPFS CID should be the same if the files are equal, I've taking a look at the generated ABI for each case and noticed that there're exit codes that doesn't belong to the common contract, the one I want the address to be calculated, but from the contracts that it's being imported into.

[2024-02-11T19:05:54] **Aleks Noid**: thanks, this code and the link to this example contract above from you helped me a lot!  
yes, but i'm also trying to keep attributes that the contract calculates itself, accordingly, i create StringBuilder : with the necessary type/values.
 let attr: StringBuilder = beginString();
    attr.append("[{'trait_type':'attrName1','value':'");
    attr.append(data.attrName1.toString());
    attr.append("'},{ ............many attributes..........").
    // ...many other attributes
 But if the final string takes up more than 1 Cell, then storeSlice does not allow this to be done (the method stops with an error), that is, i am looking for a best practice, a way (as far as possible in Tact) to create from string of more than 1 cell and save it as onchain data in the correct snake format for NFT.

        repeat (size) {

            if (code < 26) {
                result.storeUint(code + 65, 8);
            }
            if (code >= 26 && code < 52) {

            if (code >= 52 && code < 62) {
                result.storeUint(code + 48 - 52, 8);
            }
            else if (code == 62) {
                result.storeUint(45, 8);
            }
            else if (code == 63) {

            }

The contract has already been created and it's open.  [#12083](https://t.me/tactlang/12083)
[2023-12-28T13:31:36] **Alex**: I'm not asking you to write me a contract. I'm just asking you to help me run the contract...  [#12081](https://t.me/tactlang/12081)
[2023-12-28T13:28:15] **Alex**: I bluntly admitted that I have no knowledge. 

I'm moving away from the task of deploying a smart contract and making it work. 

The contract is already in place (it works and it's open). 
I'm just asking you to save me time and help me deploy it for myself. 

I think it won't take a good specialist long. 

I will deploy the code and learn TACT gradually.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [12077](https://t.me/tactlang/12077)) [#12080](https://t.me/tactlang/12080)

[2023-12-28T11:56:18] **Alex**: I've been trying to get help from the community to turn the contract around for 4 days now!
I admit, I have no experience in creating smart contracts and may be asking primitive and possibly stupid questions.

But logically it's simple, there is a contract on tact (it works ) 

We need to deploy it 
1. to do this you need to deploy an environment (blueprint, ton emulator or nudjan.io
2. to deploy it you need to edit several files, because the most complicated part is the contract itself (50% of the code is already there).
3. Deploy to testnet then to mainnet

What I have already done:
I deployed an empty blueprint (npx blueprint test npx blue print run worked) here is the created contract
https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQCsmbdWOCYeTkTnZb0yizoRr9k_p6Bi2qJjCp2wwFw4MgOp

Here is the main contract - https://github.com/wety-dev/jackpot-ton/blob/main/jackpot-ton.tact

What do I need to add?

paste the jackpot-ton.tact code into contracts/toncoin.tact
I assume that I need to make changes to the files
build/toncoin/tact_Toncoin.ts and scripts/deployToncoin.ts.

But I don't know what code should be added or edited?  [#12068](https://t.me/tactlang/12068)

virtual inline fun mint(msg: JettonMint) {
    // minting code
}

receive(msg: JettonMint) {
    self.mint(msg);
}
 or abstract function:
// override this function in inherited contract
abstract inline fun mint(msg: JettonMint);

receive(msg: JettonMint) {
    self.mint(msg);
}

then:
override inline fun mint(msg: JettonMint) {
    // override the virtual method or implement abstract
}

However, if you need context in your function, I recommend that you pass the context as an object to your virtual function to avoid losing the context.
virtual inline fun mint(ctx: Context, msg: JettonMint) {
    require(ctx.value >= self.min_value);
    // minting code

Is it on master chain ? At the end we should have a database mechanism to find those instruction and bring them in scope. Anybody can help?

Why this question is important,  because in smart contract that have huge usecase , like wallet by using this technique we can reduce storage fee significantly,  like v5 of tonkeeper, in their repo , they said we used shared library,  in master chain . But I don't know how they did that , and which process should be carried out to have this facilities.

[2023-12-20T16:48:27] **Dmitry | backend4you.ton**: using 4 int256 (into one cell) does NOT need using any map.
if you want to use map - it will take more space (and cells) of course. You may try to store them in testnet and check storage length in explorers, or check dic serialization algorithm to understand how complex it is.  [#11704](https://t.me/tactlang/11704)

[2023-12-20T16:11:05] **Aleks Noid**: Hi guys)! I want to continue my questions about map type.

ok, let's say we changed our mind about storing strings)

1. and i decided to store 1000 'bool' type in a map<Int as uint8, Int as uint256> of 4 elements (250 'bool-bits' in each uint256). how much will it cost the contract per year? Based on the calculations here: about 0.00072 TON + a little over 4 uint8?

2. or let's say i decided to store another - map<Int as uint16, Int as uint256> of 1000 elements and also in the contract. Then it will cost : approximately 0.184 + 0.012 TON per year.

Is that right? or how is the map stored in the contract, will it be more expensive?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [11663](https://t.me/tactlang/11663)) [#11700](https://t.me/tactlang/11700)

1. The contract is initialized
2. you need to init the contract.. and save a map with 100 000 strings in it for example (how much will such calculations cost.. hm).
Like this?:

struct TypeValue {
  str: String;
}

trait Lib {
  lib: map<Int as uint32, TypeValue>;
  lib_length: Int;

  owner: Address;

  receive("init lib") {
    require(sender() == self.owner, "Invalid owner");
    let i: Int = 1;
    // ... 100000 records
    while (i <= 100000) {
      self.lib.set(i, TypeValue{ str: "Hello " });
      i = i + 1;
    }
    // or.. if the lines are different, then there should be a trait for 100000 lines of code      
      // self.lib.set(1, TypeValue{ str: "A str" });
      // self.lib.set(2, TypeValue{ str: "B str" });
      // self.lib.set(3, TypeValue{ str: "C str" });

My setup:

// fee_percent: Int as uint8 = 5

receive(msg: SetFeePercent) {
        let ctx: Context = context();

        self.fee_percent = msg.fee_percent;
}

Message send: 

// set_fee_percent
const messageBody_set_fee_percent = beginCell()
    .storeUint(285412494, 32)
    .storeUint(0, 64)
    .storeUint(2, 8) //fee percent

However, there are still some we have been unable to reach. We need to collect the machine specifications from all validators to progress the upgrade as quickly as possible. If you maintain a TON validator node, please get in touch with us urgently so we can resolve the network performance issues.

[2023-12-07T16:24:05] **Anthony Tsivarev | TON**: TON20 Inscription Use-case on TON
Starting on December 5th, The Open Network (TON) experienced an incredible spike in network activity, thanks to the BRC20 Bitcoin Ordinals type of inscription use-case, called TON20, launched by the Tonano team. 

Producing over 2 million transactions increased our network usage by 61 times within just half an hour. TON Community is proud to witness a creative use case take-off in TON driven by independent participants in the ecosystem.

Moreover, this sudden growth has revealed many interesting insights for our blockchain. Dynamic sharding technology worked as expected. At its peak, TON split into eleven shardchains, stabilizing at five shardchains to handle the heavy load.

At the same time, this phenomenon also revealed where the community should work to swiftly onboard the exponential increase in network activity expected in the near future. Network validators must ensure that TON is supported by hardware capable of scaling to the performance demanded by high usage.

Network Performance Delays
This peak interest also came with a severe congestion of TON network, where validation was severely delayed even though the network validators are still producing blocks. 

Popular wallets like @Wallet and Tonkeeper have paused the service temporarily.

TON core developers are aware of the issues affecting users and are working on TON blockchain. An initial technical report is available here. TON core team will be providing us with a further update within the next 24 hours. 

We thank you and the community for your patience and unwavering support as we go through the growing pains together, preparing for the unprecedented growth season expected in the near future.  [#11221](https://t.me/tactlang/11221)

Recently, Anton Trunov, the new lead for the Tact language at TON Foundation, created a Tact Roadmap for the development of the Tact language.

We aim to make the Tact language as good as possible for developers. You can help improve the Roadmap by participating in a survey.

The survey consists of 7 questions, but it's crucial to reveal your experience so Anton can tailor the Tact language to your needs:

[2023-11-29T11:27:46] **Howard**: This might be the missing feature for us in Tact: 
We can't place 'contract initialization code and data' in 'StateInit' from off-chain and then store it at the on-chain level.

The scenario for this is as follows: Let's say I want to write a contract that is only callable by any 'jUSDT jetton wallet.' Then, I would need this method to mandatorily ensure that only the qualified addresses can send the message through.  [#10848](https://t.me/tactlang/10848)
[2023-11-29T11:02:39] **Howard**: through the ton sdk, we can get the Jetton WalletCode in Cell.


Is this Cell can turn into StateInit as we deal with in Tact?  [#10846](https://t.me/tactlang/10846)

[2023-11-27T06:03:36] **He wm**: When there are two contracts A and B
The user carries Ton and requests contract A. Contract A carries the Ton requested by the user and initiates a send request.
The structure is roughly
`
send(SendParameters{
     to: "to address",
     value: 0,
     mode: SendRemainingValue,
     body: B contract {owner: sender(), amount: user Ton}.toCell()
})
`

If a require exception occurs in contract B after receiving a request from contract A, will the user's user Ton be automatically returned to the user, or does it still need to be written in contract B to manually return it?  [#10727](https://t.me/tactlang/10727)

[2023-11-26T05:21:01] **Howard**: From my experience: For creating the new contract(contract initially), you have to "one-line" processing the contract.

Use an unique initial seed to avoid any address conflicts 
For example deployTime then use now() from state init:

[2023-11-23T07:27:39] **Francesco Sullo**: In an Tact contract for TON Network, I have the following code:
let givenSupply: Int = 0;
if (self.queries.get(msg.query_id) != null) {
            dump("Verified);
            givenSupply = (self.queries.get(msg.query_id)!!).givenSupply;

It dumps "Verified", but it never dumps givenSupply.

[2023-11-22T08:15:48] **Howard**: Oh, one thing I've noticed in Tact is that using emit will finalize the transaction. 

In Solidity, emit doesn't pause the transaction during execution and will continue to execute the next line of code continuously.

[2023-11-22T01:22:52] **Francesco Sullo**: I am using Blueprint for a Tact project. If I put a dump(123) in the contract, the build works without errors, but during testing I don't see and debugging. Any idea why?

[2023-11-21T16:43:21] **Mikhail Bulba**: but the problem is still here:

1) Parent contract receive's message

[2023-11-21T13:38:51] **üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ üÖ∑üÜÇüÜÑ**: The process of retrieving multiple token prices from oracle is not straightforward on TON, owing to its message passing mechanism. Is there any best practices?

In my imagination, the workflow should be:
1. contract call the oracle to get price with callback payload
2. the oracle process the request
3. the oracle reply with callback payload  [#10471](https://t.me/tactlang/10471)
[2023-11-21T13:30:55] **Howard**: Yeh, you can. Since fetching the contract data from another is based on "message calling". You can't directly calling other contract's get method there. 

TON doesn't have get function on on-chain level in each contracts itself. Check the Tact-by-example code.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [10466](https://t.me/tactlang/10466)) [#10470](https://t.me/tactlang/10470)

[2023-11-16T11:17:06] **Howard**: ‚ùì One question: What is the best way to do the sorting?

I am considering implementing the liquidation feature in TON. 

However, a contract in TON shouldn't store all the contract statuses (for example, we usually don't recommend using map<Int, Int> in this manner).

If I store the status in each Balance contract (let's say), then how can we sort all the contract values and select the lowest value from each contract?  [#10244](https://t.me/tactlang/10244)

[2023-11-16T09:51:12] **Francesco Sullo**: I have following the conversation but it looks like a multi-multi structure is not possible.  Let me make an example with pseudocode.
Let's say I have 3 addresses: 
owner1Address, owner2Address and buyerAddress
I would expect that 
map[owner1Address][buyerAddress]
is different than
map[owner2Address][buyerAddress]

[2023-11-15T15:59:59] **Denis U**: oh shit.. really I can call the same mint 2 times !! and throw the error if it's already inited @hitasp  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [10152](https://t.me/tactlang/10152)) [#10153](https://t.me/tactlang/10153)
[2023-11-15T15:58:34] **&rey 2ne:v**: So,
1. You don't need to check if mint request is greater than last item. Just send mint message, that's all.
2. NFT should respond with error if it's already initialized. Bouncing isn't the best solution since it can lose user address (or it could be kept in StateInit, but that should be checked separately).
3. Collection should check for those error responses and return remaining TON to user.  [#10152](https://t.me/tactlang/10152)

[2023-11-15T15:54:22] **ùêªùíæùìâùí∂ùìàùìÖ**: the base idea is editable nft standard, but with 2D index, in 1D index we can check if mint request are grater than last item or even we can store next_index, 
but he needs to validate if item with index [n,k] already minted or not, at mint time. after minting was ended their is no need for validating  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [10146](https://t.me/tactlang/10146)) [#10147](https://t.me/tactlang/10147)
[2023-11-15T15:47:15] **&rey 2ne:v**: You may also make NFT respond to collection whether it existed before or not.
(Probably this doesn't need any modifications, since if NFT is initialized it'll likely bounce next init messages).  [#10146](https://t.me/tactlang/10146)
[2023-11-15T15:45:19] **&rey 2ne:v**: Based on the shards of your idea I've heard here:
if items are uniquely identified by their content, you just don't need any checks: second NFT won't get created, as the message will be sent to the same address as the previous one with that content.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [9989](https://t.me/tactlang/9989)) [#10145](https://t.me/tactlang/10145)
[2023-11-15T15:44:00] **ùêªùíæùìâùí∂ùìàùìÖ**: According to the conversation I had with him in private and the details of the idea, I know that both the time-based solution and your sharding proposal will not help him. 

He needs real-time information that can only be provided through the main contract or off-chain at mint. 

If I had the opportunity to explain his idea, I am sure that we could benefit from the knowledge of others. 
I am still not sure about my solution which I shared with he in DM  [#10144](https://t.me/tactlang/10144)
[2023-11-15T15:43:31] **&rey 2ne:v**: You can't check whether other contract (which probably is in another shardchain) exists without sending a message.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [9999](https://t.me/tactlang/9999)) [#10143](https://t.me/tactlang/10143)
[2023-11-15T15:33:20] **Mehdi Baneshi**: I respectfully disagree with your viewpoint. My proposed solution leverages an extensive array of entities, addresses, or smart contracts with minimal storage fees. The subcontract in question requires only a small balance for occupation (storage fee), remaining in standby until activated as needed (following the actor model). This design ensures code capability, providing advantages such as extensibility, configurability, and upgradability. The solution is designed for ease of maintenance and facilitates straightforward owner changes for future needs, which are crucial for our specific use case.

I am intrigued by the concept of indexing you mentioned and would appreciate further clarification. I am concerned about the potential overcomplication of our code and whether time-based indexing is necessary, given the inherent collision resistance of these entities.

[2023-11-15T15:05:39] **ùêªùíæùìâùí∂ùìàùìÖ**: I had discussions with @zerex about the idea he has, this can't help, he must follow the sequency indexes to solve this gas cost problem  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [10139](https://t.me/tactlang/10139)) [#10141](https://t.me/tactlang/10141)
[2023-11-15T14:58:53] **Mehdi Baneshi**: @zerex , what you think about this solution.
You craft your entry contract such that it will receive some parameters and initiate another contract for one nft(this means sharding in smart contract design pattern). Discuss here.
https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons

As any sub contract is also a contract and has a unique address , you craft your main contract such that it sends an external message, in this case initial hash or new address .Then your layer 3 app listens for any updates and has arbitrary business logic for any purpose.
So two entities are in your hand without needing to touch Blockchain, doing everything you need without any gas .
For future reference also you can utilize them . I assume some fundamental concepts of how TVM and Smart contract work are already available in  mind .For clearance I am open discussing more.Maybe I am wrong.  [#10139](https://t.me/tactlang/10139)

In summary, native reserve costs 0.0127 gas unit, whereas deduct method costs  0.012215. 

Thus, native reserve is a bit more expensive but more accurate. (native reserve exactly remain 1 TON in contract, but meanwhile dedeuct method will remain about 0.991 in the contract)

However, it is equivalant to sending a message attached with 2 TON to ourselves, thus it is more expensive than just dwindle 2 ton from ctx.value (they have some tolerance of the test, so this way is feasible to pass the challenge). You may uncomment this line to check the gas usage.

[2023-10-31T12:15:03] **ùêªùíæùìâùí∂ùìàùìÖ**: good question, because you had an force load for item that doesn't exist so you had error in process:
let userAddress: Address = msg.userAddressMap.get(i)!!;
I have an suggestion for you same as Tact's docs, use a checker before reading data from maps:
if(msg.userAddressMap.get(i) != null) {
    let userAddress: Address = msg.userAddressMap.get(i)!!;
    self.tests.set(userAddress, 132123);
}
you are forcing map reader via !! that mean you are ensure map has value at this key, avoid that  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [9222](https://t.me/tactlang/9222)) [#9223](https://t.me/tactlang/9223)

so try this:

            i = i + 1;
        }
    }

    get fun valueAa(user: Address): Int {
        if(self.tests.get(user) == null) {
            return 222;
        }
        return self.tests.get(user)!!;
    }
and test:
    const userAddressMap = Dictionary.empty<bigint, Address>();
    userAddressMap.set(0n, owner.address);
    await contract.send(owner, { value: toNano(1) }, {
      $$type: "Users",

To change slice - you must create new cell and rewrite it all. Two unchanged int32 first (so you have to store them in variables while reading), then new 3rd, then unchanged 4th.

[2023-10-24T19:09:51] **Mikhail Bulba**: i'm trying to store some data in contract, there will be just a few Ints. 

Since Cell is the most universal type of data i want to store it as cell. But if i want to change just one field in this cell i need to load each INT from cell, change some of them and then reupload it back to cell.

I want to do the next things:

Intead of parsing cell i want to do something like:
struct MyStruct {
   a: Int;
   b: Int;
}

some_data: Cell;


fun save_initial_struct(data: MyStruct) {
    self.some_data = data.toCell();
}

   let parsedStruct: MyStruct = Cell.ParseToStruct(self.some_data)// i know that there is no method like this, just showing what i mean

storeCoins stores VarUint16, which means that the first 4 bits indicate how many bytes are needed to store the number. In this case, the number 10000000 fits in 24 bits, which makes 3 bytes.

[2023-10-21T19:17:13] **Maxey Liu**: You can check this link(https://github.com/Ton-Dynasty/tondynasty-contracts/blob/85b17b393274e5aa6a59ad4442998868c8fd60e7/tests/NftAuctionExample.spec.ts#L269C1-L269C13)

Example:


expect(setUpAuctionResult2.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: alice.address,
            to: nftAuctionMarket.address,
            success: false,
            exitCode: 58706, // Auction was already set for this NFT.
        });


You can use exitCode to test whether it throw error. Your error code of your string (fun require(condition: Bool, error: String)) will be at build/contract_name/tact_contract_name.md

for this example:

[2023-10-21T16:07:08] **Railgun**: https://github.com/zenixls2/tact-challenge/blob/main/contracts/5.tact#L113
My solution for handling this, well still have bug that this should be self.totalNftsHold without -1  [#8586](https://t.me/tactlang/8586)
[2023-10-21T16:03:52] **Railgun**: Also in the context mentions: The smart contract randomly chooses some NFT from the available NFTs (including the newly incoming one) and gives it to the user in exchange for the brought NFT
So there might be a case that client send one without anything stored in nft. In that case, return back the new one.  [#8585](https://t.me/tactlang/8585)
[2023-10-21T16:03:12] **Spite Moriarty**: There are no Slice for value type. Actually, we can store as uint256, but there was bug, which does not allow you to use Int as ...

That's why I used Address as value type 
I fixed it and created PR  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [8583](https://t.me/tactlang/8583)) [#8584](https://t.me/tactlang/8584)
[2023-10-21T15:59:05] **Railgun**: And maybe in task5 we could store nft as Slice instead of Address, so that no additional conversion call is required?  [#8583](https://t.me/tactlang/8583)
[2023-10-21T15:59:03] **Spite Moriarty**: Address consists of 267 bits. We need only last 256 bits, because they are data bits. First 11 were constant in context of this contest  [#8582](https://t.me/tactlang/8582)

[2023-10-21T13:07:14] **Spite Moriarty**: My solutions for Tact Challenge: https://github.com/aSpite/tact-challenge-contracts.

I added a README in which I described almost all the optimizations in order to make it convenient to read the code. There are also some points about inaccurate tests. 

The most interesting hacks:

- Storing the address as uint256 since Tact uses tact_verify_address every time an address is received, which consumes a lot of gas.

- Using commit (c4 and c5 saving) and throw(0) to abruptly exit the function when you only need to send a message without changing storage.

- The correct order of data storage in the storage. It is important to understand how Tact works with storage. It depends on which value will be the first on the stack. With the correct sequence of values used and their location in the storage, a significant improvement in gas can be achieved.  [#8571](https://t.me/tactlang/8571)
[2023-10-21T11:40:46] **Grit**: Gas usage optimization in Tact is not obvious nor trivial task. It would be great to have this topic covered in official tact docs.  [#8565](https://t.me/tactlang/8565)

What I have: 
 - top up from admin
 - balance and price works
 - echange works 
 - price throws if any jetton count is zero
 - send jettons back in case not enough jettons to exchange
 - throw if unknown jetton and send it back
 - wrote tests that check exchange messages, balances and prices

[2023-10-19T13:16:25] **Andy Russo**: let's say X is 200, Y is 75, and we send a message with SendRemainingValue. Would nativeReserve(100, 0) and nativeReserve(100, 4) be the same thing?
Because incoming message's value is always used first, Y and nativeReserve(100, z) would also be spent/reserved from the incoming value. And so sending remaining value would result in 25 nanotoncoins being sent back regardless, right?

Also to add to the discussion, I'd guess that +8 flag would be for unreserving an amount of nanotoncoins  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [7998](https://t.me/tactlang/7998)) [#8001](https://t.me/tactlang/8001)

[2023-10-19T13:04:37] **Dmitry | backend4you.ton**: ---
+4 - Increase amount by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase)
---
so nativeReserve(100, 0+4) will reserve 200 (source) +100, so last msg will send
200+X-Y-(200+100)
so it will fail if X is less than 100+Y  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [7997](https://t.me/tactlang/7997)) [#7998](https://t.me/tactlang/7998)

[2023-10-19T12:58:08] **Dmitry | backend4you.ton**: disagree.

---
Docs:
nativeReserve calls native raw_reserve function with specified amount and mode.
The raw_reserve() is a function that creates an output action to reserve a specific amount of nanotoncoins from the remaining balance of the account.
---

your source balance 200

you recieve msg with X tons for gas, you balance is 200+X after recieve phase

execution of your code (compute phase) spend some gas Y, so you have balance 200+X-Y, and you created "output action" to reserve 100 and second output action to send msg with SendRemainingBalance.

in action phase, "reserve 100" executed and now you have "available" balance 200+X-Y-100, which will be sent with SendRemainingBalance  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [7994](https://t.me/tactlang/7994)) [#7996](https://t.me/tactlang/7996)

[2023-10-18T19:08:08] **üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ üÖ∑üÜÇüÜÑ**: I agree with your perspective. Unit testing is indeed a powerful method for identifying bugs and optimizing gas usage, but it truly shines when we have a thorough understanding of every checkpoint and detail in our specification. Therefore, if we successfully pass all the test cases, local testing becomes crucial. It is important to consider that if we lack insight into how the server conducts the tests (how they implement their underlying contracts), writing tests may only help us identify issues that we are already aware of.

(Similar to the scenario when using self.forward)

If there is a balance in the contract and you want to clear it, then using SendRemainingBalance will bring the contract's balance to zero, even if this withdrawal transaction involves only a small amount of TONcoin.

Also we have notifications coming from two given jettonWallets. And according to the specification notifications should come from our jettonWallet, and there should be two of them.

[2023-10-17T11:46:54] **Heydar Mahmoodi**: not just that , if you think about the underhood, they implemented a map<string, messagReceiverFunction> and then it should use log(n)*len(yourString) to execute your messageRceiverFunction, in best case it's hash not map, but when your  using the function , you  just call the function address ...
I think this is one of the reasons .
and another one is that you said limiting ...
also we have more too.

---Are these wallets specific or they can be anything with trait Jetton from stdlib?
---Who is set as owner in corresponding field of these wallets?
-How does user send a transfer request?
--How does user transfer jettons in this request?
---How does dex contract consume this jettons?
-How should dex contract transfer jettons to user?
-How does user reject a transfer? Should it be in the same way as regular transfer? 
-What is the correct formula for the price? If I use your formula "amountOfJettonAOnContract * decimal / amountOfJettonBOnContract" then example should give 5 * 10^9.

Let‚Äôs say you have 1000bits. In Cell. You can read them ‚Äúforward only‚Äù, so you start by making Slice from Cell. This Slice points to first bit of 1000.

If it was stored as uint256 but you read it as uint32‚Ä¶ you will receive wrong value.

[2023-10-13T18:41:11] **Howard**: Trying to run get method on non-active contract

means your contract didn't deployed properly. Pause/fallback in the middle I think. 

Better to check the contract code, or deploy on test-net to find the exit code and see which contract failed to reply  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [6038](https://t.me/tactlang/6038)) [#6039](https://t.me/tactlang/6039)
[2023-10-13T18:33:00] **Mario**: I have another question. I am receiving an error on my test:
Trying to run get method on non-active contract

      1022 |     async getGetWalletData(provider: ContractProvider) {
      1023 |         let builder = new TupleBuilder();
    > 1024 |         let source = (await provider.get('get_wallet_data', builder.build())).stack;

In this line:
https://github.com/Tarnadas/orderly-ton-amm/blob/master/tests/OrderlyAmm.spec.ts#L172

I'm trying to build integration tests, so trying to mock as few as possible. I used Jetton Tact reference implementation to deploy JettonMaster in my test.

From my understanding this should output the same address, but it doesnt:
console.log('ownerJettonA', ownerJettonA.address);
console.log('await tokenA.getGetWalletAddress(owner.address)', await tokenA.getGetWalletAddress(owner.address));


So I assume this is the reason why I receive this error.
Does anyone have an idea what's going wrong?

Also do I really need the Jetton reference implementation? Could I do this with the JettonMaster from ton library without relying on my own test Jetton code?  [#6038](https://t.me/tactlang/6038)

[2023-10-11T18:43:13] **Daniil Sedov**: That‚Äôs why in TON we often use parent->child smart contract architecture where instead of a big map you deploy separate child smart contracts for each entry. This approach can be a bit harder to implement but it can scale.  [#5657](https://t.me/tactlang/5657)
[2023-10-11T18:42:13] **Daniil Sedov**: Storage limit currently is around 30k keys for the whole contract. Also remember that the more keys you have in a map, the more costly is to operate with it.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [5654](https://t.me/tactlang/5654)) [#5656](https://t.me/tactlang/5656)
[2023-10-11T18:30:34] **Ken M**: I'm struggling to understand the storage limitations. 
1/ If I have a map<Int, Int>, can it grow indefinitely?

[2023-10-11T16:17:42] **Howard**: 1/ I think from my knowledge in FunC, the sentence should more specific that "Adding more receive method in Tact is more like adding more if-else‚Äôs in FunC. Yes, it‚Äôll cost more gas to execute.


2/ I thought
receive(msg: Slice), receive(msg: String), receive() are three different situations.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [5612](https://t.me/tactlang/5612)) [#5617](https://t.me/tactlang/5617)
[2023-10-11T16:13:49] **Daniil Sedov**: 1. If you write more if-else‚Äôs, yes, it‚Äôll cost more gas to execute.

2. Then why do you even need to split these receivers into a several different ones? Just do receive(){‚Ä¶}  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [5611](https://t.me/tactlang/5611)) [#5612](https://t.me/tactlang/5612)
[2023-10-11T16:12:43] **Howard**: 1. Does FunC also have the same effect that "more receive methods lead to higher gas costs when receiving messages"?
  
This is super super interesting.

2. I am just testing and trying to write a smart contract that will pass all received messages (Slice, String, null OP, etc.) to the owner's address! 

Then this contract should have a standardized contract that I can implement tho.  [#5611](https://t.me/tactlang/5611)
[2023-10-11T16:08:56] **Daniil Sedov**: Yes, right. You can define more functions in FunC, but the incoming message only triggers one of these two  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [5609](https://t.me/tactlang/5609)) [#5610](https://t.me/tactlang/5610)
[2023-10-11T16:08:00] **Howard**: Right, got it.

Is that why the syntax of FunC is only based on two sides: recv_internal and recv_external?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [5608](https://t.me/tactlang/5608)) [#5609](https://t.me/tactlang/5609)
[2023-10-11T16:05:06] **Daniil Sedov**: Because after the compilation, TVM smart contract has only one ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù function for internal messages which is recv_internal.
And when you define several receivers in Tact, they all are just being compiled into a bunch of if-else‚Äôs.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [5607](https://t.me/tactlang/5607)) [#5608](https://t.me/tactlang/5608)
[2023-10-11T16:04:02] **Howard**: Wait,
1. I thought those receive functions don't affect each other?

2. Why do multiple receive functions increase the gas cost, even when I specify that each receive function is targeting a different use case?

1. In the past, if I deployed the NFT collection simultaneously, it was straightforward. This is because I knew how to calculate each NFT item's address within the smart contract.

2. The issue arises when an NFT item is transferred. It doesn't convey useful information in a consistent manner. This means the contract simply receives OwnershipAssigned(0x05138d91) and can't determine if it's the desired NFT item or not.

1) for (2) are you referring to inputting into the forward_payload?

[2023-10-06T16:08:58] **Howard**: Great questions!

1/ The forward_ton_amount in text refers to "the amount of TonCoin you want to allocate for this TokenNotification messages."

This message format is required to notify the original owner that "He has transferred a certain amount of Jetton to someone."

2/ Correct. You can input whatever you desire, regardless of the parameters you wish to pass. On DeDust.io, the text message is displayed to notify everyone at the explorer level that this Tx is for adding Liquidity, Exit, Swap, etc.

3/ It depends on the action you want the receiver contract to perform. For a standard Transfer reminder in message passing, 10^-9 TonCoin is acceptable.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [4862](https://t.me/tactlang/4862)) [#4863](https://t.me/tactlang/4863)
[2023-10-06T13:55:35] **Hakiem**: Hi, I have a few questions regarding Jetton contract in Tact https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/new_/sources/contract.tact.

For this portion of the TokenTransferInternal message:

         // 0x7362d09c - notify the new owner of JettonToken that the transfer is complete
        if (msg.forward_ton_amount > 0) { 
            send(SendParameters{
                to: self.owner,
                value: msg.forward_ton_amount,
                mode: SendPayGasSeparately + SendIgnoreErrors,
                bounce: false,
                body: TokenNotification {
                    queryId: msg.queryId,
                    amount: msg.amount,
                    from: msg.from,
                    forward_payload: msg.forward_payload
                }.toCell()
            });
        }

1) Is this used to trigger additional logic in the owner contract upon receiving jettons?
2) Is it possible to send other parameters in the TokenNotification message as per this standard? Maybe in forwardPayload? (idk what this param is for tbh)

1/ You can't place emit after the self.forward message; it will completely fail and pause the transaction.

2/ You need to measure the GasInStorage as we did in the NFT standard. Then, set the remaining TonCoin value to pass the message and trigger the emit event from the current Smart Contract address.


The method 1 will failed, but nor method 2.  [#4634](https://t.me/tactlang/4634)

[2023-09-29T12:42:50] **Howard**: hmmmm can't understand properly, what is your suggestion here? 

I think I will update a bit in Tact-template, adding the test case from:
import "@ton-community/sandbox";
import "@ton-community/test-utils";


Current testcase example is using @tact-lang/emulator, I think some people is in confusing when download the Tact-template.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [4508](https://t.me/tactlang/4508)) [#4514](https://t.me/tactlang/4514)
[2023-09-28T19:42:13] **Howard**: Good catch! I can help fix this. Thank you.

Correct. If we want to filter specific senders, then adding that line is a reasonable choice.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [4509](https://t.me/tactlang/4509)) [#4510](https://t.me/tactlang/4510)
[2023-09-28T19:34:55] **Alexander Draginski**: Hi guys!
I found a possible bug in this Tact example from https://tact-by-example.org/06-authenticating-children

This chapter is dedicated to children contract authentification by it's address to make children impersonation impossible. However, children constructor doesn't check that parent address passed as an argument is really a message sender:
    init(parent: Address, seqno: Int) {
        self.parent = parent;
        self.seqno = seqno;
    }

With this code we can create a child from another parent contract and pass Victim parent address as an argument.
Using self.parent = sender() is not an option as it won't affect child address this way.
We can add require(parent == sender() ) to make it secure.

Did I get it right or there's something I've missed?  [#4509](https://t.me/tactlang/4509)

Seem's like i used the whole possible limitation for contract size, cause it's have embeded structs. The solution was:

To create your own "bicycle" by using booleans and other low-cost data types for representation for some data. For example i was developing a small game on TON and the struct has tons of fields, some of theme were like
firstPlayer: Address,
secondPlayer: Address,

winner: Address?;

Seems like i used to many bytes, so i changed "winner" field to "bool" type where "true" - firstPlayer, and "false" means secondPlayer  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [4410](https://t.me/tactlang/4410)) [#4422](https://t.me/tactlang/4422)

[2023-09-21T07:20:28] **Howard**: Hi everyone, I've just updated my Jetton Token repo:

- It now supports Comment during transfers, similar to the feature available on TonKeeper.

- I've included a max_supply field in my template, as it seems to be important in most cases. This is also emphasized by https://minter.ton.org/.

- I've added instructions for generating a Transfer URL when you're trying to send the Jetton Token to a third person. (In Jetton, if you want to transfer your Jetton Token to someone, you need to send a message to YOUR Jetton Wallet, not to the new recipient's wallet.)

- forward_ton_amount can be set as lower as possible: Same as TelemintNFT. I don't know why, but looks like we can set (1e-9 TON) in forward_ton_amount without any error.

I meant prove_ownership, this message should be processed and the contract should reply with ownership_proof, the same as for request_owner, also destroy and revoke processing should be implemented. So SBT is not just removing transfer message processing  [#4300](https://t.me/tactlang/4300)
[2023-09-14T02:54:32] **Howard**: Oh, right.

Even if the NFT Item itself does not implement the Transfer method, it's still possible for people to send the ownership_assignment message to the NFT item.

correct? @nonam3e  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [4298](https://t.me/tactlang/4298)) [#4299](https://t.me/tactlang/4299)

Does anyone know how can I use Tact dump() method proreply?

I created a tact.config.json file in the root of my project with debug: true option.

[2023-09-04T04:59:41] **Howard**: Great question!

1/ I have set a receive function to inject it. We can only know the "current Staking contract's Jetton Wallet Address" after the Staking contract has been deployed.

2/ The second point is that this approach can prevent front-running. People who want to deposit tokens into the contract could otherwise track the deployer's transactions to gain an advantage.

However, this is not a critical consideration at this stage.ü§ï  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [4112](https://t.me/tactlang/4112)) [#4114](https://t.me/tactlang/4114)

[2023-08-30T20:04:47] **Ryan Dennis**: Is this a fair statement: Tact was conceived to bridge this gap by amalgamating familiarity from popular programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Solidity.

[2023-08-17T16:42:32] **Howard**: True, but I can't find exit code 40 in my output file.

Alternatively, 2) ton.cx may have given me the wrong information. There is no exit code 40, never ever. But on the flip side, ExitCode: 0 on TonViewer is also not that helpful for me to navigate.  [#3893](https://t.me/tactlang/3893)

[2023-08-17T16:41:23] **Howard**: Especially, the error in TonViewer is exit code 0.

As you can see, the error comes from 0x178d4519, the standard Jetton Token's TokenInternalTransfer method.

I have dealt with Jetton before, so the code I used is the same as the code I used previously.

Potential ideas:
1/ Because I am using the TonKeeper UI, the forward_ton_amount is less than the code. 

Since the Tact code pays higher gas than FunC's Jetton Token?

2/ (Still thinking and trying to find why...)  [#3891](https://t.me/tactlang/3891)
[2023-08-17T16:39:32] **nonam3e**: It's not a standard error, you should find what it means in the code of the contract  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3889](https://t.me/tactlang/3889)) [#3890](https://t.me/tactlang/3890)

function in contract:
    get fun getProfile(): Profile {

        return Profile {
            pub_count: self.profile.pub_count,

            image_uri: b.toCell(),

            follow_nft_uri: b1.toCell()            
        };
    }

tonclient call:
    const itemData = await client.runMethodWithError(nabiProfileAddress, "getProfile", []);

but i get this error: Unsupported stack item type: list

The getter function does not return any list:

struct Profile {
    pub_count: Int as uint64;
    handle: Cell;
    image_uri: Cell;
    follow_nft_address: Address?;
    follow_nft_uri: Cell;

[2023-08-07T17:17:39] **Roman Nguyen**: Yes, but my question is not about sandbox. Question about ton-core)
If you compile .tact it will create sample_Contract.ts file, which will import
    TupleBuilder,
    DictionaryValue
} from 'ton-core';

but sandbox works on @ton/core

It's two different libs. So it's impossible to use this .ts file in sandbox without fixind lib by hands (its not really good, cuz after build it always needs to be fixed and there is no garantee that interfaces of libs always be the same)

In the Tact docs, it's written that I can use this file with sandbox. So, the question is how? )  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3801](https://t.me/tactlang/3801)) [#3802](https://t.me/tactlang/3802)

[2023-08-07T17:05:04] **Roman Nguyen**: Hi people! Probably for this question I will be pelted with pissing rags, but I still dare to ask, because it's time to seriously play Tact.

Actually the question is that, as I understand it, the most reasonable way to test now is a blueprint (or a sandbox, it's not so important), which is written in the documentation (https://docs.tact-lang.org/tools/typescript).

The fact is that as a result of compilation .ts file appears (which, according to the documentation, should be used in sandbox) and it uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-core And sandbox https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core is used

So the question is, how do you, colleagues, test? Do you rewirite imports by your hands? What is the fundamental difference either? How is it all brought to a single interface?  [#3795](https://t.me/tactlang/3795)

[2023-08-04T20:36:48] **&rey 2ne:v**: 0. commit() assures that set_data will have effect even if the transaction fails.
1. If we accept external message but don't commit, then execution failure will lead to contract state not being changed, and the external message will be run (and accepted) again and again ‚Äî probably, until the contract runs out of balance.
2. Wallets are especially prone to failures: insufficient balance, invalid destination address, etc.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3756](https://t.me/tactlang/3756)) [#3759](https://t.me/tactlang/3759)

tact project config is located in .compile.ts but this requires latest version of bp (check npm to know what it is)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3746](https://t.me/tactlang/3746)) [#3753](https://t.me/tactlang/3753)
[2023-08-04T18:18:28] **Howard**: Oh, okay. That's also a good point.

[2023-07-30T12:08:29] **nonam3e**: Also you may deploy jetton wallet, where master address is a treasure, and then send TokenTransferInternal messages from treasure to deployed jetton wallets. But it's better to write your own jetton root, you'll have to use it anyway  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3720](https://t.me/tactlang/3720)) [#3721](https://t.me/tactlang/3721)

[2023-07-30T09:44:40] **Chris Kruszewski**: ok, time for tests. How can I deploy jetton and count jetton wallet for my smc?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3718](https://t.me/tactlang/3718)) [#3719](https://t.me/tactlang/3719)
[2023-07-30T03:21:14] **nonam3e**: you may store the address of the jetton wallet and validate it. If the contract uses several jettons, the notification should be received from one of them, and depending on the sender you can understand what coin you received.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3716](https://t.me/tactlang/3716)) [#3718](https://t.me/tactlang/3718)
[2023-07-30T03:17:04] **nonam3e**: haven't seen docs about it. Tact generates special get_method supported_interfaces that looks like _ supported_interfaces() method_id {
    return (
        "org.ton.introspection.v0"H >> 128,
        "org.ton.abi.ipfs.v0"H >> 128,
        "org.ton.deploy.lazy.v0"H >> 128,
        "org.ton.chain.workchain.v0"H >> 128
    );
}
It could help to exactly understand the interface of communication with the contract. Haven't seen someone supported it, but it looks like a nice feature.
When you add @interface("org.aboba.v1337") the hash of the string inside brackets will be added to the tuple that supported_interfaces get method returns  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3715](https://t.me/tactlang/3715)) [#3717](https://t.me/tactlang/3717)

[2023-07-22T19:17:21] **Howard**: To be more specific, let's say I am designing Vaults that will aggregate funds, but only from the Vaults that I trigger, into a single contract before proceeding to the next step.

Key issues:
1/ For ContractA, how can it determine when to execute the next step? Since it doesn't know how many contracts will send transactions to it.

2/ Even if "we, as admins," send external messages to those contracts (1,2,3), how can we be certain that those transactions will arrive at Contract A simultaneously?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3641](https://t.me/tactlang/3641)) [#3643](https://t.me/tactlang/3643)
[2023-07-22T19:13:32] **Howard**: One intriguing question arises: suppose I have more than 5, or even 10 contracts, triggered by an external message simultaneously (at the same Logical Time) and they all send transactions to a single contract.

In theory, these transactions should be able to be sent at the same time, correct? 

But how can I inform the receiving contract (Contract A in this scenario) when all the incoming transactions are completed? 

Would this be achieved by uploading the query_id?  [#3641](https://t.me/tactlang/3641)

[2023-07-18T14:03:52] **nonam3e**: Yeah, but strings may have references, and equal_slices only compare the data of the first cell. It can be used if you're sure string length is less than 127 chars  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3555](https://t.me/tactlang/3555)) [#3558](https://t.me/tactlang/3558)

[2023-07-18T02:13:20] **sajib 01707746572**: Interview With Narek Abovyan, Head of TonTech at FSL

The TON & Company YouTube channel has released a fresh interview with TonTech team member and TON ecosystem contributor Narek Abovyan.

Narek talked about his fascinating journey in the blockchain industry, his role in Getgems, and his contribution to the creation of TON NFT standards (in particular, the Soulbound standard). 

He also talked about the Getgems launch, TonTech‚Äôs plans, a collaboration with TON Play, and more.

We recommend watching the interview ‚Äî it‚Äôs available on YouTube.  [#3549](https://t.me/tactlang/3549)

[2023-07-16T18:14:45] **Vladimir Alefman**: Hi guys! Does anyone know if there is a nft contract on the Tact anywhere?  [#3542](https://t.me/tactlang/3542)
[2023-07-16T15:54:56] **None**: Will we have more update for Tact then?  [#3541](https://t.me/tactlang/3541)
[2023-07-15T22:49:08] **Nick Nekilov**: Almost all types are stored inline way.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3536](https://t.me/tactlang/3536)) [#3537](https://t.me/tactlang/3537)
[2023-07-15T22:47:33] **nonam3e**: Nice, I thought all structs are stored as cells in the contract, so I tried to find an another solution  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3534](https://t.me/tactlang/3534)) [#3536](https://t.me/tactlang/3536)
[2023-07-15T22:46:45] **Nick Nekilov**: Replace it with value: Int as uint64; and it will be stored as uint64.  [#3535](https://t.me/tactlang/3535)
[2023-07-15T22:46:03] **Nick Nekilov**: Not really. This struct will be stored as int257.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3532](https://t.me/tactlang/3532)) [#3534](https://t.me/tactlang/3534)

[2023-07-15T22:43:58] **Nick Nekilov**: I would declare the type:

struct MyInt {
  value: Int;
}

And declare all needed operators for working with MyInt.  [#3532](https://t.me/tactlang/3532)
[2023-07-15T22:42:33] **Nick Nekilov**: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to use usual arithmetic operators, but you can write a wrapper over asm-instructions.

I would go with other solution.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3530](https://t.me/tactlang/3530)) [#3531](https://t.me/tactlang/3531)
[2023-07-15T22:40:39] **nonam3e**: yeah, it is clear, but how can I declare that this primitive will be stored as an integer and func will process it as an integer  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3528](https://t.me/tactlang/3528)) [#3530](https://t.me/tactlang/3530)

[2023-07-14T13:52:33] **Vlad**: have a question about bounced messages:
docs say: 
"Currently in TON bounced messages have only 224 usable data bits in the message and no references."
No references means I cannot access the body of message?  [#3520](https://t.me/tactlang/3520)
[2023-07-14T13:51:53] **&rey 2ne:v**: It was temporarily removed for reimplementation.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3515](https://t.me/tactlang/3515)) [#3519](https://t.me/tactlang/3519)

[2023-07-14T13:29:49] **Nick Nekilov**: I think it‚Äôs about combination Tact + blueprint.
Imports don‚Äôt work at all. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  [#3517](https://t.me/tactlang/3517)
[2023-07-14T13:24:14] **nonam3e**: You may just copy it to your directory  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3515](https://t.me/tactlang/3515)) [#3516](https://t.me/tactlang/3516)
[2023-07-14T13:20:10] **Vlad**: Sad, thought I can use this https://github.com/ton-core/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton.tact  [#3515](https://t.me/tactlang/3515)
[2023-07-14T13:18:42] **nonam3e**: You should implement it yourself  [#3514](https://t.me/tactlang/3514)
[2023-07-14T13:18:22] **nonam3e**: There's no jetton lib yet  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3512](https://t.me/tactlang/3512)) [#3513](https://t.me/tactlang/3513)

[2023-07-11T17:47:26] **Daniil Sedov**: Yes, you can utilise merkle proofs for that.

You can use Dictionary as a structure that will hold all users and your smart contract will only need to store the hash of that dictionary.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1499](https://t.me/tactlang/1499)) [#3492](https://t.me/tactlang/3492)

[2023-07-10T14:43:53] **sepezho**: hey, is there any tact highlighter for nvim?  [#3485](https://t.me/tactlang/3485)
[2023-07-09T19:11:13] **None**: perfect, thanks!  [#3483](https://t.me/tactlang/3483)
[2023-07-09T19:09:53] **Howard**: There has the error code list in your TS files (output folder)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3481](https://t.me/tactlang/3481)) [#3482](https://t.me/tactlang/3482)
[2023-07-09T18:56:23] **None**: how can i check exact message that was thrown by require()?

im using sandbox to test contract  [#3481](https://t.me/tactlang/3481)
[2023-07-09T16:17:51] **&rey 2ne:v**: Or those properties could be embedded into code cell directly.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3477](https://t.me/tactlang/3477)) [#3480](https://t.me/tactlang/3480)

[2023-07-09T16:09:43] **None**: hey guys, which syntax highlighting extension should i use for VSCode that supports Tact?  [#3478](https://t.me/tactlang/3478)
[2023-07-09T16:06:57] **Nick Nekilov**: It may worth to add a modifier "readonly" for contract properties.
We can have properties that are configured during initialization but never modified again.
We could put all these properties to a separated cell, parse it but never repack it again.
Since "packing" a cell is one of the most expensive instruction it can be a reasonable optimization.  [#3477](https://t.me/tactlang/3477)
[2023-07-09T11:27:51] **Howard**: yes  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3474](https://t.me/tactlang/3474)) [#3475](https://t.me/tactlang/3475)
[2023-07-09T11:26:32] **&rey 2ne:v**: External messages have to be enabled in the project config.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3472](https://t.me/tactlang/3472)) [#3474](https://t.me/tactlang/3474)

[2023-07-09T11:16:12] **Howard**: I thought we didn't integrate this yet.  [#3472](https://t.me/tactlang/3472)
[2023-07-09T11:01:15] **&rey 2ne:v**: Although, if you are trying to process external messages sent to your contract, Tact has external(msg: ...) handlers.  [#3471](https://t.me/tactlang/3471)
[2023-07-09T11:00:19] **&rey 2ne:v**: External message cannot be sent by other contract.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3469](https://t.me/tactlang/3469)) [#3470](https://t.me/tactlang/3470)
[2023-07-09T10:58:43] **Howard**: Can we integrate "External Messages" to trigger contracts with FunC functions in Tact?

"I want to be able to execute this kind of transaction, which allows a smart contract to process transactions upon receiving off-chain messages."

like this 0x67df1781  [#3469](https://t.me/tactlang/3469)

[2023-07-05T16:01:24] **Howard**: Hi all, I am testing ctx.value in various cases on the test-net:

As you can see, the value I store in the address changes dynamically even I sent the same amount of TON. 

However, since I pass the same value every time, I can't understand why the ctx.value I store fluctuates significantly.

1/ What causes the ctx.value of the unit we store on the contract to be different (i.e., the gas fee for the validator)?

2/ How can I accurately record how much people 'Stake in TON' for this transaction? This could potentially result in high gas costs if the contract logic is complex.

The solution from getgems.io suggests that users pay more TONcoin when they create an auction contract or call the Transfer function.  [#3445](https://t.me/tactlang/3445)
[2023-07-05T11:57:13] **Hakiem**: @howard_peng, in receive(msg: Transfer) in NftItem contract, should include 
require(ctx.sender == self.collection_address || ctx.sender == self.owner, "invalid sender") in order to prevent unauthorized transfers.

How can I describe struct to deserialise payload:(Either Cell ^Cell)?

I ended up with such solution:
payload: Cell?;
inlinePayload: Slice as remaining;
Are there any other solutions?  [#3433](https://t.me/tactlang/3433)

Since the same Order_id can definitely have different orders, I need to convert Bool to Integer, then concatenate it for a unique index parameter to create a unique ID.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3400](https://t.me/tactlang/3400)) [#3401](https://t.me/tactlang/3401)

[2023-06-30T14:30:05] **Howard**: @nonam3e, do you think there's a more gas-efficient way to convert a Boolean to an Integer for concatenation as the index and for storage? 

This refers to the topic we discussed earlier.  [#3399](https://t.me/tactlang/3399)
[2023-06-29T22:27:04] **Howard**: Hello everyone, I've shared the repository for the Staking Jetton Example:

1/ For Staking Legic, one of the challenges is learning how to calculate the Jetton Wallet for "each Wallet" that receives the jetton token. Once you understand how to use the "JettonMaster" function from the "ton" SDK, everything becomes much easier.

2/ If you want to list your Jetton token on DEXs like STON.fi or Megaton.fi, remember to launch it using Tact. This is crucial because the initial Jetton code that we write in Tact may differ from FunC. Consequently, you might be "unable" to use the "JettonMaster" function to get the correct jetton wallet address!

3/ Therefore, using the message "AddingJettonAddress" is the recommended way to inject the Jetton Root data into the Staking Contract. I highly recommend launching your jetton token at https://minter.ton.org first, then passing the data to the contract.

Initially, I planned to build the IDO logic in practice, which is why I first built the Staking Contract here to measure the Score.

It's similar to the ve-Curve logic but in a simpler way, as we measure the Size of the Jetton Token you stake, and weight it based on the time you have in the Staking contract.

Then, any contract can call the "GetWeighted" method to fetch the Weight for a user in a message-based way. This approach is more interesting to me than the structures I've seen in Ethereum, and it's an easier way to achieve the same goal.

As you can see in the screenshot, you can test it by transferring different amounts of tokens at various times to obtain different weight results. The diverse design of the Jetton Wallet, where each address stores separate data, allows for greater flexibility in designing your DeFi feature."  [#3398](https://t.me/tactlang/3398)
[2023-06-28T18:46:51] **Howard**: There are many more possibilities for experimenting with NFTs in TVM than with ERC721, because each NFT uses a single address and stores its data (parameters) separately. This is analogous to an isolated position in Perpetual Futures.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3396](https://t.me/tactlang/3396)) [#3397](https://t.me/tactlang/3397)

[2023-06-24T08:09:15] **Howard**: Do the mappings in FunC and Tact have the same disadvantages as those in TVM when it comes to sorting values? For example, if I want to build an order-book-based trading system, what would be the best design case for this? Should I structure the order book as an NFT collection, where each OrderID represents an NFT item?

Would that approach help to mitigate the sorting problem and save on gas costs? Even so, we would still need a mapping to store which Int is smaller or larger, right? (I.e., sorting the orders based on an integer value).  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3326](https://t.me/tactlang/3326)) [#3346](https://t.me/tactlang/3346)

[2023-06-23T11:08:06] **Vladimir Alefman**: Hi friends, üëã

Many of us here are trying to figure out Tact and want to be able to create our own smart contracts. So, I decided to share with you my free course on developing smart contracts in Tact!

The goal is to make entering into the tone of development friendly.

In this course, I've tried to make it as easy as possible to explain all the intricacies I know. We'll start with the basics, from creating and testing a smart contract. 

Lesson Titles: 

Video 1: Introduction to TON

Video 2: Installing and setting up the development environment, the first smart contract

Video 3: Syntax and data types in Tact

Video 4: Messages between contracts, Throwing Errors

Video 5: TON coin sending, working with gas

Video 6: Syntax and data types in Tact 2

Video 7: Traits.

Video 8: From ERC20 to Jetton.

Video 9: The nft collection contract

Video 10: The first dapp on TON integrated with Telegram

Two lessons have been done so far. And please don't forget to forward this message to friends who also want to start developing on TON. We'll make our community stronger together!

[2023-06-22T13:39:30] **Howard**: then based on the Message-based feature to pass each Contracts' data to the main contract? Probably better.

Just store the data in each Contract Addresses like NFT Item rather than in single one!  [#3331](https://t.me/tactlang/3331)
[2023-06-22T13:38:40] **Howard**: ok, maybe I need use "Sharing" your data in to separate Addresses like NFT Collection tho  [#3330](https://t.me/tactlang/3330)
[2023-06-22T13:33:34] **Daniil Sedov**: Actually it's more complex, but for simple approximations that's enough  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3326](https://t.me/tactlang/3326)) [#3329](https://t.me/tactlang/3329)

[2023-06-22T13:14:01] **Howard**: Will the cost of storing the value into the mapping increase recursively as the list grows larger and larger?

For example, will the cost for ID#1 versus ID#100 be the same? Or will the gas cost differ?  [#3325](https://t.me/tactlang/3325)
[2023-06-22T12:48:57] **None**: and store in a 1bit size of data in the Builder datatype  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3298](https://t.me/tactlang/3298)) [#3324](https://t.me/tactlang/3324)
[2023-06-22T12:48:26] **None**: So, if the value of Bool is true, we will store -1. If the value of Bool is false, we will store 0. 

But what if we want to store null? Can we put in 1? 

In other words, can we use the if {}...else if {} statement to achieve the storeBool method?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3297](https://t.me/tactlang/3297)) [#3323](https://t.me/tactlang/3323)

[2023-06-12T10:59:55] **Howard**: Yes, that was the purpose for people to easily understand the on-chain transaction since you and your users can check on Explore and know that they were sending the transaction with the comment text to mint the NFT.

You can expand the message (TL-B) format based transaction by changing the Tact file, such as coding Transfer as 0x5fcc3d14.

You can also add more receive method functions and call them using self.mint, which is the internal function we have already defined in the code below.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3225](https://t.me/tactlang/3225)) [#3226](https://t.me/tactlang/3226)
[2023-06-12T08:29:05] **Hakiem**: Hey @howard_peng. For the nft-standard-template, is there a way to deploy the contract without minting the first NFT? I believe 'body' variable in line 12 of contract.deploy.ts contains the bin message to be appended to the deployment link. I've tried replacing "Mint" with an empty string or changing the 'body' variable to be of type string but the transaction always reverts.  [#3225](https://t.me/tactlang/3225)

[2023-05-27T10:57:45] **Howard**: yeh, followed the first question, I am testing with NFT Staking: Stake NFT then get Jetton Token.

I think using Tact is way more easy to implement those business logic.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3122](https://t.me/tactlang/3122)) [#3163](https://t.me/tactlang/3163)

[2023-05-26T09:52:54] **Howard**: - Is there any possibility that the contract could be invoked by others even if we set the code like this? There's no chance of that happening, correct?

- What's the difference between using the Trait from the deployable standard code base (for instance, importing the deployable library by @steve_kite )? 

- Does it lead to improved gas efficiency?

[2023-05-23T10:40:13] **Ilya Kaurov**: In this example, I'm simply writing the message as a whole. However, what I actually need is to append the data each time a new message is received. When writing, it is necessary to check if the key exists. Yes, I am aware that there is no length or count method for dictionaries. Of course, I can keep track of the dictionary's length, but how can I compute it?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3143](https://t.me/tactlang/3143)) [#3146](https://t.me/tactlang/3146)

[2023-05-22T17:04:46] **nonam3e**: The contract doesn't really have complicated functions. It just has a lot of data in it and many simple functions.

[2023-05-22T08:41:59] **Howard**: One advanced application of msg.forward_payload: Is it possible to append the data of the NFT item itself after the Transfer method has been executed? According to TEP62 here (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md), they "should be equal".

However, since we can't directly view or fetch information from the NFT itself using view/get function, we have to solely rely on the message.  [#3121](https://t.me/tactlang/3121)

[2023-05-20T14:21:48] **Steve Korshakov**: op ids never changed starting from v1.0.0 everything before was marked as unstable. So I don‚Äôt think opcodes are changed, but you can override it‚Äôs value just put it in the brackets after keyword message  [#3115](https://t.me/tactlang/3115)
[2023-05-20T14:12:38] **Carl Jonson**: Hi, guys.
I‚Äôve faced with an issue of backwards compatibility of contracts on Tact

My v1 version had one kind  generated of opcode value for the operation, but v2 had a different generated opcode for the same operation

I know I can manually change auto generated by Tact funC code  and to insert the v1 opcodes values 

But still, is there a more correct way to support backwards compatibility of already deployed and used contracts  [#3114](https://t.me/tactlang/3114)

My article https://blog.ton.org/the-story-of-tact doesn't directly "help to learn Tact", but I think it might add valuable context ‚Äî maybe it's a good idea to add it?

[2023-05-16T02:30:51] **Brave**: "Tact is bad but more toxic here plz."  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2854](https://t.me/tactlang/2854)) [#3096](https://t.me/tactlang/3096)
[2023-05-15T19:09:19] **Howard**: Because if we set limitations using myBalance() and allow users to send transactions with bounce: false, it may create an incentive for users to increase the balance of the contract by continuously sending such transactions themselfs.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3094](https://t.me/tactlang/3094)) [#3095](https://t.me/tactlang/3095)
[2023-05-15T16:07:40] **Daniil Sedov**: Then why would the user send with bounce: false flag?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3091](https://t.me/tactlang/3091)) [#3094](https://t.me/tactlang/3094)

[2023-05-15T15:57:23] **Howard**: One proper solution might be using a parameter storing the Number of balance(and modified once message change contract status), rather than using "myBalance()".  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3091](https://t.me/tactlang/3091)) [#3092](https://t.me/tactlang/3092)
[2023-05-15T15:56:31] **Howard**: for some cases, like "only certain amount of TON in the contract then enable to claim...etc"  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3089](https://t.me/tactlang/3089)) [#3091](https://t.me/tactlang/3091)
[2023-05-15T08:41:56] **Daniil Sedov**: Why would you want it to still bounce  [#3089](https://t.me/tactlang/3089)
[2023-05-15T08:41:50] **Daniil Sedov**: That's the purpose of setting "bounce: false" ‚Äî to force contract not to bounce back on errors  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3087](https://t.me/tactlang/3087)) [#3088](https://t.me/tactlang/3088)
[2023-05-15T08:06:27] **Howard**: Can we enforce a transaction to bounce back even if the user sends a Transfer method with bounce: false?


For now the TON will stuck in the contract for mistake.

[2023-05-14T09:38:15] **Howard**: So this is the way that we can get out_put message from the ABI code?

Like this te6cc.... BOCs data inside of a message output?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3069](https://t.me/tactlang/3069)) [#3082](https://t.me/tactlang/3082)
[2023-05-14T09:31:22] **Howard**: YES, I think for dton.io giving the graphQL that can fetch the BOC data for the message output is great!  [#3081](https://t.me/tactlang/3081)
[2023-05-14T09:30:59] **Howard**: 1/ what is Cell.oneFromBoc means? 
2/ Oh and we succeed! I solve by doing this:  [#3080](https://t.me/tactlang/3080)
[2023-05-14T09:15:58] **&rey 2ne:v**: te6ccu... is BOC, you can base64-decode it and feed into something like Cell.oneFromBoc.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3075](https://t.me/tactlang/3075)) [#3079](https://t.me/tactlang/3079)

[2023-05-14T00:58:10] **Howard**: 1/ Is the approach I tried incorrect?
2/ @steve_kite, could you please explain why we need the ABI in your previous reply?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3075](https://t.me/tactlang/3075)) [#3077](https://t.me/tactlang/3077)
[2023-05-14T00:52:04] **Howard**: but will get error since the { throw Error('Invalid prefix'); }  [#3076](https://t.me/tactlang/3076)
[2023-05-14T00:49:59] **Howard**: Thanks! Followed the modules we got in TS files, I tried to decode the message I got here like this:

"te66ccu...." is the message I got from dton.io API.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3067](https://t.me/tactlang/3067)) [#3075](https://t.me/tactlang/3075)
[2023-05-13T19:36:33] **Steve Korshakov**: it is useful to store some kind of logs, for example when NFT was minted explicitly  [#3072](https://t.me/tactlang/3072)
[2023-05-13T19:32:04] **Howard**: The practical uses for this feature (please correct me if I'm wrong) are:

1/ Compared to sending a message to a contract, storing it, and then using the get method to read it from on-chain to off-chain, using emit() can help us avoid paying high gas fees to check the data.

2/ Another advantage is the lower latency since you can read the message through the "out message body", decode the message, and get the data we want by fetching the transaction data from the API.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3069](https://t.me/tactlang/3069)) [#3071](https://t.me/tactlang/3071)
[2023-05-13T19:15:12] **Steve Korshakov**: i have a very hacky library that could parse messages using ABI:
https://github.com/tact-lang/ton-abi

Here is an example how to forward types from bidings:
https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-emulator/blob/a9a41d0be50cf03612bfbf15814c3a716cbccac2/src/emulator/ContractSystem.ts#L175

Then just call registry.parse and it would hopefuly parse your message

It does not support everything, i think dicts are not implemented.  [#3069](https://t.me/tactlang/3069)
[2023-05-13T19:04:31] **&rey 2ne:v**: *I suppose you already have some way to fetch account transactions.
You need to fetch transactions and check outgoing messages. The messages directed to null are external-out messages.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3064](https://t.me/tactlang/3064)) [#3067](https://t.me/tactlang/3067)
[2023-05-13T18:56:11] **Howard**: Sure, here's your text with improved grammar and an attempt at providing a potential answer:

Fundamentally, a message will be delivered "on-chain", but it won't be directed to any specific address.

However, the current challenge for me is finding an API that can assist in fetching information from the body of the message, so I can decode the message for the emit message I've set.

In this screenshot, it's 0xcdbea1c3.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3064](https://t.me/tactlang/3064)) [#3066](https://t.me/tactlang/3066)
[2023-05-13T12:34:26] **Howard**: ü•µ need to know how to fetch the emit() data through the TS file we got after compiled  [#3064](https://t.me/tactlang/3064)
[2023-05-13T11:50:25] **Howard**: From my understanding, this is the method that we can monitoring "Minting process" is success or not right? Rather than just Error ExitCode stages. 

This is exactly the same as emit in Solidity  [#3062](https://t.me/tactlang/3062)
[2023-05-13T11:49:27] **Howard**: what API you mentioned? to fetch data from on-chain event emit()  [#3061](https://t.me/tactlang/3061)
[2023-05-13T11:04:16] **Daniil Sedov**: Wow! It's very good that this was added to Tact.

These are external messages or "messages to nowhere". They can actually have some kind of  a recipient (just an arbitrary bytes value). They are stored in blocks as any other messages, so you can access them using any preferred API.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3059](https://t.me/tactlang/3059)) [#3060](https://t.me/tactlang/3060)
[2023-05-13T10:52:53] **Howard**: Does anyone try out `emit()` yet? 
And how we read it off-chain through RPC?  [#3059](https://t.me/tactlang/3059)
[2023-05-13T10:45:29] **Howard**: üî•  [#3058](https://t.me/tactlang/3058)
[2023-05-11T12:19:52] **Howard**: OK, since the Tact version of jetton code in init Cell might be different with the FunC one. 


I will say if you want to build any expand contracts like DEXs or Staking contract in Tact, you will need import these functions to fetch the correct Jetton Wallet init_code  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3050](https://t.me/tactlang/3050)) [#3054](https://t.me/tactlang/3054)
[2023-05-10T14:38:23] **Andrew**: let's try  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3052](https://t.me/tactlang/3052)) [#3053](https://t.me/tactlang/3053)
[2023-05-10T14:36:28] **Howard**: will you like to help with me check our Tact version of Jetton Wallet code(init code) is the same as the jetton token in FunC? (oUSDT, iUSDT, wTON... so on so for)

I think I will take times to do so as well tho.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3050](https://t.me/tactlang/3050)) [#3052](https://t.me/tactlang/3052)
[2023-05-10T14:34:58] **Howard**: I see, same as NFT item <> NFT Collection tho. got it got it.


So basically I will need implement/import the Jetton Wallet contract initially with my Jetton Staking contract tho(to catch the init code)  [#3051](https://t.me/tactlang/3051)
[2023-05-10T14:26:19] **Andrew**: here you can see the address calculation logic for jettons in func - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-utils.fc  [#3050](https://t.me/tactlang/3050)
[2023-05-10T14:25:15] **Andrew**: refer to https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons#jetton-processing-on-chain  [#3049](https://t.me/tactlang/3049)
[2023-05-10T14:24:19] **Andrew**: you need to know the jetton master address of the jetton you want to receive, as well as jetton wallet code for that jetton. Upon receiving the transfer notification, you can calculate the correct address of the jetton wallet using that data + sender address from transfer notification forward payload, and compare it with the sender address of the message you received  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3046](https://t.me/tactlang/3046)) [#3048](https://t.me/tactlang/3048)
[2023-05-10T14:24:17] **Howard**: Oh, you might suggest editing the logic inside the TokenTransferInternal, but since not all jetton tokens would support that, it might not be a feasible solution. For instance, the WrappedTON contract is already deployed in the FunC file."  [#3047](https://t.me/tactlang/3047)
[2023-05-10T14:21:35] **Howard**: A question arose while dealing with a staking contract: The Jetton staking contract receives a message from TokenNotification(0x7362d09c), but the message itself doesn't contain the "Jetton Minter Contract information".

My question is, how can we ensure that the user is transferring the correct Jetton token into the staking contract?

- I know the staking contract I wrote can functionally support all the transferred tokens, but in our case, we don't want that. 

- In other words, how can we define a "Wallet Contract" that can only receive a specific Jetton token?  [#3046](https://t.me/tactlang/3046)
[2023-05-10T13:52:46] **Howard**: ah, okok  [#3045](https://t.me/tactlang/3045)
[2023-05-10T13:52:16] **Howard**: Seems docs missed loadAddress?  [#3044](https://t.me/tactlang/3044)
[2023-05-10T13:51:42] **Andrew**: .loadAddress()  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3042](https://t.me/tactlang/3042)) [#3043](https://t.me/tactlang/3043)
[2023-05-10T13:51:08] **Howard**: let's say I store Address into a Cell in TypeScript, which function I can use in to load the Address?  [#3041](https://t.me/tactlang/3041)
[2023-05-09T11:24:28] **Howard**: But yeh, I think I get your point and understand how "Jetton Transfer" implement in other "non-wallet contracts". Thanks a lot @Arterialist !  [#3039](https://t.me/tactlang/3039)
[2023-05-09T11:23:47] **Howard**: OK seems works. Although we can't see the "Message" itself in Comment area on Explorer.  [#3037](https://t.me/tactlang/3037)

[2023-05-09T06:19:22] **Howard**: The Staking Contract will got exitCode: 130, which is "Invalid incoming message".


My assumption is that, we can't compressed the "Stake Message format for the Staking contract" like that? 

Since the Cell data should be correct. Maybe someone had tried this before as well?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [3029](https://t.me/tactlang/3029)) [#3031](https://t.me/tactlang/3031)
[2023-05-09T06:17:24] **Howard**: Hey @Arterialist, I have tried using both "custom_payload" and "forward_payload" on both sides.

Here is my TypeScript code that compresses the data format I want to send with, which is the message format I want to execute. 

In this case, it is the "Stake" function in my Staking contract, and it is the new owner of this Jetton amount. (Shows in second graph, and those modules were generated by Tact lang)  [#3029](https://t.me/tactlang/3029)

What if we want to allow the owners to transfer (stake) jetton in a staking contract by implementing "advanced Tx in Transfer messages"?

[2023-04-20T13:33:45] **Howard**: I don't know, any feedback or any FunC code want to migrate in Tact feel free to DM me.

The idea is that I hope to get more feedback for the code itself, since I'm trying to build something in production but can't find reliability or auditing support(more code I already tried). I believe that sharing more code in the community can help Tact grow more quickly.  [#2946](https://t.me/tactlang/2946)
[2023-04-20T13:33:06] **Daniil Sedov**: What's the idea behind this? Collection owner will just share their funds to NFT stakers?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2944](https://t.me/tactlang/2944)) [#2945](https://t.me/tactlang/2945)
[2023-04-20T13:30:49] **Howard**: Just want to share with you that I just tried to build an example of an NFT staking contract today. You can mint the NFT then:
- Put the NFT into a staking status, although it's not strictly considered staking since the ownership of the NFT doesn't change.
(*Compared with NFTs for sale on Getgems.io, where you have to transition ownership to a new contract.)

- The amount of TON each NFT can claim is based on the Weight it has in the total weight amount of the pool. The weight is based on the duration you choose when  staking.

- To put it simply, if we use the Transfer function(we defined on TEP62)  to stake the NFT, the Transfer function won't be able to bring the information of the NFT itself to the staking contract (e.g. rarity information, level of NFT like we did here in this example).

- But you can still implement your Transfer function with more customized information in custom_payload, although that could make the contract too complicated I guess.

More questions and expansion:
1/ Why don't you design the feature like the NFT sale contract in Getgems.io?

Since the core feature for NFT staking should be based on rarity, I added the Level to the NFT item itself (in code, randomly generated from 1 to 100). This means the ratio of the share you have in the staking pool is based on the level of the NFT itself and the duration you choose, such as 24 hours, 3 days, or more.

2/ What else can we do with this?
Basically, we will need to add a "cool-down" feature, so people can't flash deposit and stake NFT to get a heavy share of weight and then claim the TON coin, etc.

3/ Can we implement Jetton claiming as well?
Sure, we can! But since I think it's easier to implement this staking feature here than staking NFTs and then claiming Jetton tokens.  [#2944](https://t.me/tactlang/2944)

[2023-04-10T16:57:22] **Yuri**: Got it. I'd like to know because there's a TEP standard that I would need to provide the address as Slice. I want to know if I can return it as an Address.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2882](https://t.me/tactlang/2882)) [#2884](https://t.me/tactlang/2884)
[2023-04-10T16:39:03] **Howard**: You will need to convert to Slice data type with Address in FunC.

But in Tact will be much more easier, Address is Address. The Slice usually use for specific usage like forward_payload, here is the example:  [#2882](https://t.me/tactlang/2882)

[2023-04-01T11:09:45] **Howard**: Honestly, from my knowledge, you can't do that since walletV4 is also the smart contract itself. 

This means you can't distinguish whether the address is a ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù or whether the smart contract is for NFT marketplace purposes.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2824](https://t.me/tactlang/2824)) [#2825](https://t.me/tactlang/2825)

[2023-03-28T07:53:14] **Howard**: You can use it as a multiplier, meaning from an altcoin perspective, you can think of it as placing a leveraged bet by investing in the altcoin. If you examine the price correlation chart, you can conclude that in a bull market, it's better to hold onto ETH, but in a bear market, holding altcoins may have more potential for growth. This is why I refer to it as a 'weight' or multiplier from a data standpoint.

On the other hand, from a psychological standpoint, holding a larger amount of any currency feels better regardless of the type. Holding 1 billion Zimbabwean dollars feels better than $1 US dollar, for sure.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2804](https://t.me/tactlang/2804)) [#2807](https://t.me/tactlang/2807)

[2023-03-27T14:55:46] **Howard**: Would you like to see an example of a Jetton-ICO template? Check out this link: https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-ico-example/blob/552c545b0e129623cc0856ba7b036a8f661a7d27/sources/contract.tact#L29

Here are some tips for using this template:
- Set the multiplier to determine the amount of Jetton tokens people can get per TON. For example, if you set it to 2500, then 1 TON for minting can get 2500 new Jetton tokens.

- There is a 1.5% fee implemented in TON for fundraising. And only enable withdraw by initial admin.

- In Tact, make sure not to use now() inside the init() function, or your contract code will change addresses based on block height.

- You can set an expiration date based on the starting logical time you want in Unix timestamp.

[2023-03-27T13:59:51] **Howard**: ok, made some mistake. 

The length of data type coins is not long enough for jetton amounts. If you can't sure how much jetton token with the totally supply can just set with Int rather then uint32(which is range 0 to 4,294,967,295) - followed by Tact-by-example for more details  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2792](https://t.me/tactlang/2792)) [#2794](https://t.me/tactlang/2794)
[2023-03-27T09:07:56] **Howard**: What is the best recommend to avoid "Integer out of expected range"?


- it will crashed if I assign toNano(10) for the jetton amount that I want to mint with a price_weight - 10n (bigint) tho. 


Thought toNano(10) represent a call to the toNano function with the argument 10, which should convert 10 TON to nanotons, resulting in 10. 000 000 000 nanotons.  [#2792](https://t.me/tactlang/2792)

[2023-03-25T16:13:30] **Dario**: As I already said, i was taking about more complex contracts (or jetton wallet if you have MORE fields than standard one). You cant skip this optimization if everything fits in 1023 bits. But again, a simple serialization to me looks very inefficient, especially when working with complex contract (eg check ston-fi contracts)  [#2773](https://t.me/tactlang/2773)

[2023-03-25T16:10:06] **Dario**: If there are other data, you can keep static data in another cell and avoid serialization when updating storage. Just an example  [#2765](https://t.me/tactlang/2765)
[2023-03-25T16:09:58] **Steve Korshakov**: it won't improve much  [#2764](https://t.me/tactlang/2764)
[2023-03-25T16:09:17] **Dario**: There are a few optimization that can be done in tact to avoid begin_cell().end_cell() with static fields, for example, when there is a lot of data. Instead of serializating it, you can just store the loaded cell and store it directly. So you might keep that that change and static data in different cells for example.

[2023-03-21T08:14:58] **Howard**: I just uploaded my version of jetton implementation in Tact, which:
- enables minting of an arbitrary amount of tokens by only the owner set initially
- anyone can call with the command Mint: 100 to mint tokens one by one
- the status for mintability can be changed. Only the owner can close the minting feature.
- supports the Transfer function with two methods:
 a) using mnemonics to trigger it - URL
b) using a URL to transfer jetton tokens to a new owner. - URL
- Set a max supply initially when you deploy the code

[2023-03-17T06:08:55] **Howard**: 1/ I understand from the documentation that we need to keep a certain amount of TON in the contract.

2/ That's why I used a function to calculate the remaining value we need to keep in the contract, building on Steve's previous code.

3/ However, the problem arises when we need to use multiple send transactions (based on one input receive function method). In these cases, we need to properly calculate the remaining value.

Sometimes, the value I wrote like this fails. I suspect this might be due to the dynamic gas cost, which could prevent us from achieving the minimum value we set to keep in the contract.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2693](https://t.me/tactlang/2693)) [#2706](https://t.me/tactlang/2706)
[2023-03-17T06:02:27] **Howard**: to keep the contract remaining some amount of TON in there, should I use:

        send(SendParameters{
            value: 0,
            to: self.owner, 
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingBalance,
            bounce: false
        });

or

        send(SendParameters{
            value: myBalance() - ton("0.1),
            to: self.owner, 
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,

[2023-03-16T19:05:13] **Howard**: I thought of it more as a view function in Solidity, which doesn't cost much in gas. Thank you for letting me know.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2696](https://t.me/tactlang/2696)) [#2697](https://t.me/tactlang/2697)

[2023-03-16T19:02:07] **Howard**: I was only able to solve this issue by setting minTonsForStorage and gasConsumption to ton("0.1"). 

Do you know why the transaction paused there in my previous example code? It seems like there might have been an issue with the msgValue measurement.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2692](https://t.me/tactlang/2692)) [#2694](https://t.me/tactlang/2694)
[2023-03-16T18:44:07] **Howard**: Yes, and I don't use that method. I usually use the following approach: 


However, this method can't calculate properly if my Send functions are in the second, or third if loop.  [#2693](https://t.me/tactlang/2693)
[2023-03-16T18:42:18] **Steve Korshakov**: SendRemainingValue, it is a flag  [#2692](https://t.me/tactlang/2692)
[2023-03-16T18:41:49] **Howard**: I have a question about the "RemainingValue" feature. Here is an example of code: when we run multiple lines of code and need to transfer the rest of the value, we usually use the SendRemainingValue mode.

My question is, how do we properly pay for the second Send function? We need to keep some TONs in the contract for storage and the minimum gas cost, so how can we ensure that the remaining value is transferred correctly while also keeping enough funds in the contract?  [#2691](https://t.me/tactlang/2691)
[2023-03-16T17:35:24] **Howard**: What is the difference for using get fun vs (private) fun if they both can return value and passing the data to go some calculation. 

Maybe the usage in Gas is difference as well?  [#2690](https://t.me/tactlang/2690)
[2023-03-16T10:50:03] **Alex Golev**: Get Methods in the Tact version will used by the same way, just double check their signature(for example with .md output files or .tact source).

For the WalletV4 contract it was recommended to use the FunC version. There is no implementation of WalletV4 with Tact language.

Tact must be used to create new cross-contract services with complex on-chain business logic.

If I read right your task:
1) Get owner's address from "smart contract"
2) Try to use get method on owner's address.

Perhaps, open-source blockchain explorers could be helpful to research this deeper.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2688](https://t.me/tactlang/2688)) [#2689](https://t.me/tactlang/2689)

[2023-03-13T08:19:41] **Herm√®s**: What would it look like to implement an Upgradable or Proxy contract in TON? While OpenZeppelin's template is good, it can be difficult for some people to understand and implement.

One example of a challenging implementation is the Diamond Standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). It's important to consider these scenarios before implementing upgradable methods for contracts, as they can be difficult to maintain and implement.

I believe that ease of understanding is key to onboarding more developers.  [#2642](https://t.me/tactlang/2642)
[2023-03-12T07:29:44] **Howard**: To display "text message" on TonKeeper when a transaction bounces back, should we use throw or reply?

[2023-03-10T22:01:57] **Dan Volkov**: hey guys, I'm currently writing integration of tact with blueprint
here's what I currently achieved

.compile.ts looks like this:
import { CompilerConfig } from '@ton-community/blueprint';

export const compile: CompilerConfig = {
    lang: 'tact',
    target: 'contracts/sample.tact',
};

when you run npx blueprint build with the respective name, files get generated as follows:
build/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sample
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.abi
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.code.boc
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.code.fc
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.code.fif
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.code.rev.fif
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.pkg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sample.compiled.json

then there's a file wrappers/Sample.ts that only has one line:
export * from '../build/Sample/tact_SampleTactContract';
so it relies on the files in build folder existing

the spec file has minimal differences, the main one is that compile function is not called since tact embeds code into the resulting ts file

I haven't written a script for deployment yet but I expect it will have minimal differences too

please let me know what you think, especially about that "wrapper depends on files existing in the build folder"
of course also let me know if you have better ideas on how to do this, I haven't spent a lot of time making this and I barely know how tact works  [#2636](https://t.me/tactlang/2636)

Other than that, I can't think of a better way to achieve this.

[2023-03-03T11:09:36] **Daniil Sedov**: because the value is just 0.01 ton.
Yes, you should add 5 ton to the value (in this case). TON Blockchain itself doesn't know anything about your custom message structures and functions. You just send some value and some additional info attached  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2539](https://t.me/tactlang/2539)) [#2540](https://t.me/tactlang/2540)
[2023-03-03T11:09:01] **Sergei Voroshilov**: I tried it but contract balance didn't change. Only for a gas fee.
Or I should to add that ammount to the value?

      const addA: Int = msg.coinsA;
      const addB: Int = msg.coinsB;

      self.data.balanceA = self.data.balanceA + addA;
      self.data.balanceB = self.data.balanceB + addB;

      require(self.data.balanceA + self.data.balanceB > myBalance(), "Not enough money for init");

[2023-03-02T12:47:39] **Daniil Sedov**: and why would you need to sign some message by a contract?  [#2465](https://t.me/tactlang/2465)
[2023-03-02T12:47:32] **Daniil Sedov**: "signing" messages usually means that you just sign it with your private key and store the signature in the beginning of data.
but smart contracts usually don't have any private keys (it would be strange to store the private key publicly on-chain) so it makes no sense  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2463](https://t.me/tactlang/2463)) [#2464](https://t.me/tactlang/2464)
[2023-03-02T12:46:30] **Gajesh Naik**: new to Tact. so tons of questions in mind haha. 

- what's the alternative to address(this) in tact?

- can a contract sign messages? (i assume yes)  [#2463](https://t.me/tactlang/2463)
[2023-03-02T12:45:19] **Gajesh Naik**: oh okay  [#2462](https://t.me/tactlang/2462)
[2023-03-02T12:43:24] **Daniil Sedov**: but you can't get that info in the same transaction. the only way is to send some "request" message and wait for "response" message  [#2461](https://t.me/tactlang/2461)
[2023-03-02T12:42:35] **Daniil Sedov**: only if the contract B has some opcode which returns the message with it's owner (in this example)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2459](https://t.me/tactlang/2459)) [#2460](https://t.me/tactlang/2460)
[2023-03-02T12:41:57] **Gajesh Naik**: also so can i read data from other contracts?

            signature: beginCell().storeBuffer(signature).endCell()
        });
```

I'm confused by the last parameter ('notify', 'Deploy', etc...)  [#2445](https://t.me/tactlang/2445)
[2023-03-02T09:36:10] **Howard**: I am testing this code with do... until:

My question is that, the Send method never be executed. 

I can't find why. Even the test cases were fine. Hope anyone can give the feedback for this. Thanks!  [#2444](https://t.me/tactlang/2444)
[2023-03-02T08:48:14] **Andrew**: true. I guess a PR would be nice  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2441](https://t.me/tactlang/2441)) [#2442](https://t.me/tactlang/2442)
[2023-03-02T08:46:01] **Herm√®s**: wtf, ok you are right. 

And this is why "adding a few line of code" can make newbie more easy to understand. (if we put the Rust document as a example  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2440](https://t.me/tactlang/2440)) [#2441](https://t.me/tactlang/2441)
[2023-03-02T08:37:55] **Andrew**: the result of that extension function would be the ability to make a call like this: const temp = 123.pow(45)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2438](https://t.me/tactlang/2438)) [#2440](https://t.me/tactlang/2440)
[2023-03-02T08:18:58] **Herm√®s**: yeh, only the define of the "Native" functions. Would be great if we add like:

// Will let you get 27 by using pow() native function
let tempInt: Int = pow(3, 3);  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2435](https://t.me/tactlang/2435)) [#2438](https://t.me/tactlang/2438)
[2023-03-02T08:16:16] **Herm√®s**: an example like this maybe? Full of content that will give full picture of the language.  [#2437](https://t.me/tactlang/2437)
[2023-03-02T08:15:45] **Andrew**: there is an example code already, no?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2433](https://t.me/tactlang/2433)) [#2435](https://t.me/tactlang/2435)
[2023-03-02T08:12:11] **Sergei Voroshilov**: I got it. Thank you!  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2432](https://t.me/tactlang/2432)) [#2434](https://t.me/tactlang/2434)
[2023-03-02T08:12:05] **Herm√®s**: Maybe the document can put the example code in below? Kind of confusing. Since I don't code in Kotlin before.


Will send request for editing.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2428](https://t.me/tactlang/2428)) [#2433](https://t.me/tactlang/2433)
[2023-03-02T08:11:33] **Herm√®s**: like this one  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2416](https://t.me/tactlang/2416)) [#2432](https://t.me/tactlang/2432)
[2023-03-02T08:11:03] **Herm√®s**: yeh, just doing so. I am noticed this as well. But you can take reference in other's example  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2430](https://t.me/tactlang/2430)) [#2431](https://t.me/tactlang/2431)
[2023-03-02T08:10:27] **Sergei Voroshilov**: Hmm... I didn't find anything about const in documentation.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2426](https://t.me/tactlang/2426)) [#2430](https://t.me/tactlang/2430)
[2023-03-02T08:10:18] **Andrew**: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html  [#2429](https://t.me/tactlang/2429)
[2023-03-02T08:10:04] **Andrew**: more like extension functions in kotlin  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2427](https://t.me/tactlang/2427)) [#2428](https://t.me/tactlang/2428)
[2023-03-02T08:08:07] **Herm√®s**: What is extend even means? Like override in Solidity? 

https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/functions#extension-function  [#2427](https://t.me/tactlang/2427)
[2023-03-02T08:06:05] **Herm√®s**: yes, it does. You can try as const minTonsForStorage: Int = ton("0.02");  [#2426](https://t.me/tactlang/2426)
[2023-03-02T08:00:40] **Sergei Voroshilov**: it seems no ü§î  [#2425](https://t.me/tactlang/2425)
[2023-03-02T07:59:48] **Sergei Voroshilov**: is there const in tact?  [#2424](https://t.me/tactlang/2424)
[2023-03-02T07:59:20] **Sergei Voroshilov**: I haven't tried. I just used isInited instead  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2422](https://t.me/tactlang/2422)) [#2423](https://t.me/tactlang/2423)
[2023-03-02T07:36:42] **Herm√®s**: Init is the primitive in Tact. Could you not use it as a variable?  [#2422](https://t.me/tactlang/2422)
[2023-03-02T07:30:38] **Sergei Voroshilov**: If I create a field that starts with init it breaks the highlighting  [#2421](https://t.me/tactlang/2421)
[2023-03-01T19:36:53] **Gajesh Naik**: thanks! üòÑ  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2418](https://t.me/tactlang/2418)) [#2419](https://t.me/tactlang/2419)
[2023-03-01T19:36:30] **Howard**: yeh, https://github.com/ton-community/tact-jetton  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2417](https://t.me/tactlang/2417)) [#2418](https://t.me/tactlang/2418)
[2023-03-01T19:23:16] **Gajesh Naik**: or is there an example of using jetton tokens in something  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2415](https://t.me/tactlang/2415)) [#2417](https://t.me/tactlang/2417)
[2023-03-01T17:59:01] **Howard**: https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-standard-template

Just added the test cases! Let me know if you have any feedback.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1818](https://t.me/tactlang/1818)) [#2416](https://t.me/tactlang/2416)
[2023-03-01T17:58:04] **Gajesh Naik**: what is the Tact alternative for minting or transferring jetton tokens (by contract to a user)?  [#2415](https://t.me/tactlang/2415)
[2023-03-01T17:57:44] **Howard**: ok, sounds great for me. Since I think we haven't write any implement any about Validators in Tact yet.  [#2414](https://t.me/tactlang/2414)
[2023-03-01T17:57:32] **Andrew**: there's a masterchain and a workchain in mainnet  [#2413](https://t.me/tactlang/2413)
[2023-03-01T17:57:15] **Andrew**: no, it means that you can only work in workchain  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2410](https://t.me/tactlang/2410)) [#2412](https://t.me/tactlang/2412)
[2023-03-01T17:57:05] **Steve Korshakov**: you can  [#2411](https://t.me/tactlang/2411)
[2023-03-01T17:56:44] **Howard**: what is that mean? We can't deploy Tact in production yet?  [#2410](https://t.me/tactlang/2410)
[2023-03-01T17:50:44] **Steve Korshakov**: We have disabled masterchain support in tact in our latest release, candidate: https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/masterchain

Please, share you thoughts if you need it or you think that this would be a mistake.  [#2409](https://t.me/tactlang/2409)
[2023-03-01T14:19:28] **Herm√®s**: Or any better way to track "whether a wallet address having how many NFTs?"  [#2407](https://t.me/tactlang/2407)
[2023-03-01T14:18:17] **Herm√®s**: OK found, https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/#/accounts/get_address_getAddressState_get

Can use this method to track.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2404](https://t.me/tactlang/2404)) [#2406](https://t.me/tactlang/2406)
[2023-03-01T14:10:37] **Herm√®s**: üëæ  [#2405](https://t.me/tactlang/2405)
[2023-03-01T14:10:30] **Herm√®s**: just need a way to track whether "an NFT" is being activate or not lol ü§£  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2398](https://t.me/tactlang/2398)) [#2404](https://t.me/tactlang/2404)
[2023-03-01T14:09:22] **Andrew**: seems like no  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2401](https://t.me/tactlang/2401)) [#2403](https://t.me/tactlang/2403)
[2023-03-01T14:06:06] **Herm√®s**: but it works with the upper side at Arbirary method  lol  [#2402](https://t.me/tactlang/2402)
[2023-03-01T14:04:40] **Herm√®s**: they don't have api in testnet.ton.cx  isn't it?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2399](https://t.me/tactlang/2399)) [#2401](https://t.me/tactlang/2401)
[2023-03-01T14:04:16] **Herm√®s**: - How do we track the data for a button on Website?
- Why my NFT address can't pop up with the get_nft_address_by_index. It's successfully in my side when I fetch data from my TS file.  [#2400](https://t.me/tactlang/2400)
[2023-03-01T14:00:55] **Andrew**: depends on the information that you want to fetch. You can manually call get_methods (on testnet.ton.cx for example) and parse the content  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2398](https://t.me/tactlang/2398)) [#2399](https://t.me/tactlang/2399)
[2023-03-01T13:59:57] **Herm√®s**: any better choice to fetch NFT informations? https://testnet.tonapi.io is not fast enough.  [#2398](https://t.me/tactlang/2398)
[2023-03-01T13:37:30] **Steve Korshakov**: you better just return the map itself, it is cheap  [#2397](https://t.me/tactlang/2397)
[2023-03-01T13:35:46] **Howard**: What is the maximum data the mapping can return in a get method?  map<Address, Bool>;

I might store a lot of addresses in there.  [#2396](https://t.me/tactlang/2396)
[2023-03-01T13:23:26] **Steve Korshakov**: Not yet unfortunately  [#2395](https://t.me/tactlang/2395)
[2023-03-01T13:10:48] **Maksim Manylov**: can i decode a cell to testable format?  [#2394](https://t.me/tactlang/2394)
[2023-03-01T13:00:57] **Maksim Manylov**: ah, The first time this test is run, Jest creates a snapshot file that looks like this - ok now i see, thanks a lot for help  [#2393](https://t.me/tactlang/2393)
[2023-03-01T12:58:23] **Steve Korshakov**: You are reviewing snapshot and check that everything as it should be and then you commit this to the git and your test would crash when something changed  [#2392](https://t.me/tactlang/2392)
[2023-03-01T12:58:03] **Maksim Manylov**: ok looks like i need gonna read it first )  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2384](https://t.me/tactlang/2384)) [#2391](https://t.me/tactlang/2391)
[2023-03-01T12:57:34] **Maksim Manylov**: what for?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2387](https://t.me/tactlang/2387)) [#2390](https://t.me/tactlang/2390)
[2023-03-01T12:56:02] **Steve Korshakov**: Version control system, git  [#2389](https://t.me/tactlang/2389)
[2023-03-01T12:55:52] **Maksim Manylov**: what is vcs?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2387](https://t.me/tactlang/2387)) [#2388](https://t.me/tactlang/2388)
[2023-03-01T12:49:50] **Steve Korshakov**: Because it writes a snapshot that you commit to your vcs  [#2387](https://t.me/tactlang/2387)
[2023-03-01T12:46:09] **Maksim Manylov**: strange that there is no arguments in tests )  [#2386](https://t.me/tactlang/2386)
[2023-03-01T12:41:01] **Steve Korshakov**: I think the argument is a name of a snapshot ;)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2379](https://t.me/tactlang/2379)) [#2385](https://t.me/tactlang/2385)

[2023-03-01T11:42:42] **Herm√®s**: But full of Txs record will be in here:  [#2380](https://t.me/tactlang/2380)
[2023-03-01T11:42:19] **Herm√®s**: that will print or show the last line of record I think. For example,  [#2379](https://t.me/tactlang/2379)
[2023-03-01T11:38:17] **Maksim Manylov**: what does toMatchSnapshot mean here
expect(tracker.collect()).toMatchSnapshot(); ?  [#2378](https://t.me/tactlang/2378)
[2023-02-28T15:56:38] **Maksim Manylov**: contract var is not set?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2370](https://t.me/tactlang/2370)) [#2377](https://t.me/tactlang/2377)
[2023-02-28T15:51:29] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes  [#2376](https://t.me/tactlang/2376)
[2023-02-28T15:51:16] **Maksim Manylov**: how to check version? "@tact-lang/compiler": "^0.10.0" ok?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2374](https://t.me/tactlang/2374)) [#2375](https://t.me/tactlang/2375)
[2023-02-28T15:44:38] **Steve Korshakov**: In latest version yes  [#2374](https://t.me/tactlang/2374)
[2023-02-28T15:40:47] **Maksim Manylov**: can i send message from init() block ?  [#2373](https://t.me/tactlang/2373)

[2023-02-28T13:34:11] **Steve Korshakov**: multisig one is the best example of sharded contracts and much easier to reason about  [#2369](https://t.me/tactlang/2369)
[2023-02-28T13:33:56] **Steve Korshakov**: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/v0.10.1/examples/multisig.tact  [#2368](https://t.me/tactlang/2368)

[2023-02-28T13:32:19] **Steve Korshakov**: do you need it?  [#2365](https://t.me/tactlang/2365)
[2023-02-28T13:31:51] **Steve Korshakov**: it was removed recently to be re-introduced separately  [#2364](https://t.me/tactlang/2364)
[2023-02-28T13:30:33] **Maksim Manylov**: where is @stdlib/jetton imported from? where can i see the source code?  [#2363](https://t.me/tactlang/2363)
[2023-02-28T12:15:01] **Steve Korshakov**: Classical api is very unstable and it‚Äôs support is not that good  [#2361](https://t.me/tactlang/2361)
[2023-02-28T12:06:06] **Howard**: OK, I founded. The List stored with a null in value. But ClientV1 can't read properly. 

But Client4 can print all the values in the list, even the null in one of the list.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2357](https://t.me/tactlang/2357)) [#2360](https://t.me/tactlang/2360)

[2023-02-28T11:40:56] **Howard**: From the Tuple function that generated in output/TS File  [#2355](https://t.me/tactlang/2355)
[2023-02-28T11:40:07] **Howard**: any idea with this error? Stack List? Is this TonClient not support with the TS file we generated by Tact?  [#2354](https://t.me/tactlang/2354)
[2023-02-28T11:32:03] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes, there is an update function that could update time. Block numbers are not precise right now since they are not really accessible from smart contracts  [#2353](https://t.me/tactlang/2353)
[2023-02-28T06:21:21] **Maksim Manylov**: can i fast forward timestamp/blocks in tests?  [#2351](https://t.me/tactlang/2351)
[2023-02-27T20:45:16] **Steve Korshakov**: And there you can define assembly functions  [#2348](https://t.me/tactlang/2348)
[2023-02-27T20:44:51] **Steve Korshakov**: And then define native function that imports func one  [#2347](https://t.me/tactlang/2347)
[2023-02-27T20:44:32] **Steve Korshakov**: import ‚Äú./some.fc‚Äù  [#2346](https://t.me/tactlang/2346)

[2023-02-27T20:42:54] **Steve Korshakov**: i am not sure about docs though  [#2344](https://t.me/tactlang/2344)
[2023-02-27T20:42:42] **Steve Korshakov**: you can import func files  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2342](https://t.me/tactlang/2342)) [#2343](https://t.me/tactlang/2343)
[2023-02-27T20:42:11] **Maksim Manylov**: is there some way to include fift code in Tact? like assembly {} block in solidity?  [#2342](https://t.me/tactlang/2342)
[2023-02-27T20:25:09] **Herm√®s**: use

}  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2338](https://t.me/tactlang/2338)) [#2341](https://t.me/tactlang/2341)
[2023-02-27T19:48:42] **Maksim Manylov**: hello
can I test fun() as a pure function without sending messages to the contract?
just want to test some math  [#2338](https://t.me/tactlang/2338)
[2023-02-27T19:04:10] **Howard**: Correct!! I had this before.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2329](https://t.me/tactlang/2329)) [#2336](https://t.me/tactlang/2336)
[2023-02-27T19:01:20] **Kon Vik**: but you can define in a contract such variable:
_symbol1: Symbol;
then you need to initialize it.. the question is how?  [#2335](https://t.me/tactlang/2335)

[2023-02-27T18:50:13] **Kon Vik**: I think you need to add some notice in the documentation, because you might run into trouble when you need to create an empty Struct  [#2333](https://t.me/tactlang/2333)
[2023-02-27T18:46:24] **Steve Korshakov**: Will fix it in 1.0.0  [#2332](https://t.me/tactlang/2332)
[2023-02-27T18:46:16] **Steve Korshakov**: Ah I see, I forgot to implement this check  [#2331](https://t.me/tactlang/2331)
[2023-02-27T18:19:22] **Kon Vik**: because then tact generates null() for them in the funC code, and there, for example, Cell is needed... then Cell cannot be equal to null() -> you catch 7 error... the Cell variable must be initialized in your "init" function with "emptyCell()" - all variables must be initialized according to their types...  [#2330](https://t.me/tactlang/2330)
[2023-02-27T18:14:15] **Kon Vik**: the common case when you can face with this error it is the case when you have defined some global variables in your smart contract and not initialized them ALL in your "init" function  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2327](https://t.me/tactlang/2327)) [#2329](https://t.me/tactlang/2329)

[2023-02-27T14:23:41] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes you can. set_gas_limit is the method you are looking for. The problem with this method that you are going to pay for a gas, not the guy that sent a message. The problem with this is that you can drain your contract's balance. Therefore we are yet to expose it in tact since it is very tricky thing to do. I have implemented it in our TON Nominators contract, but in practice it just put stuff at risk (but it is mitigated by other contract code for checking incoming value of messages)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2292](https://t.me/tactlang/2292)) [#2297](https://t.me/tactlang/2297)

[2023-02-23T15:59:00] **Howard**: 1/ can we put in optional that can use toNano? It's hard for me to read the amount of TON in balance. For example:  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2235](https://t.me/tactlang/2235)) [#2236](https://t.me/tactlang/2236)
[2023-02-23T15:52:41] **Steve Korshakov**: right now you can call system.contract(address).state to get contract's state that includes the balance  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2228](https://t.me/tactlang/2228)) [#2235](https://t.me/tactlang/2235)

[2023-02-23T15:49:51] **Steve Korshakov**: send usually can't fail, only system.run can throw exception when external message wasn't accepted.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2231](https://t.me/tactlang/2231)) [#2233](https://t.me/tactlang/2233)
[2023-02-23T14:34:34] **Howard**: Another question: How can we get the error code in ton-emulator?

If await contract.send() fails, it won't show up in track.collect(), right?

Also, the log output is not very usable, since it can generate thousands of lines of logs.  [#2231](https://t.me/tactlang/2231)
[2023-02-23T09:12:19] **Howard**: yes, just sent. Thanks.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2188](https://t.me/tactlang/2188)) [#2229](https://t.me/tactlang/2229)
[2023-02-23T09:02:54] **Howard**: Correct me if I am wrong:
1/ We need to implement a get method to fetch the balance of a TON address since the test library does not provide a built-in function to fetch balance information.

2/ Similar question: How to get the balance of the owner address we got temporally?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2184](https://t.me/tactlang/2184)) [#2228](https://t.me/tactlang/2228)
[2023-02-23T07:06:19] **Herm√®s**: May I ask why dump didn't design as console.log that will pop the value of the contract? Rather then pop like this?

Seems not human readable.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2206](https://t.me/tactlang/2206)) [#2226](https://t.me/tactlang/2226)
[2023-02-22T18:50:24] **Steve Korshakov**: totalFees is simply incorrect in ton and have to be calculated separately (to be implemented in emulator)  [#2224](https://t.me/tactlang/2224)
[2023-02-22T18:49:50] **Steve Korshakov**: also transaction "to" also useless since we have all transactions bound to a single contract  [#2223](https://t.me/tactlang/2223)
[2023-02-22T18:49:18] **Steve Korshakov**: For example oldStatus and endStatus is reduntary since you can provide only changes in this status, but in practice it is not useful. lt is useless thing in emulator, also it could be different from time to time. now is binded to time that would break snapshots. exitCode and success is almost the same value. outMessageCount doesn't make sence since you need to test messages that were sent.

[2023-02-22T18:34:28] **Howard**: the deploy you mean here is deploy in side the test cases, or I always have to deploy the contract to test-net?

[2023-02-22T18:33:15] **Steve Korshakov**: we will introduce naming of addresses later to abstract it away, that would reduce dramatically changes in snapshots  [#2217](https://t.me/tactlang/2217)
[2023-02-22T18:28:53] **Andrew**: Yes, I mean it under manual validating, it's not very convenient, since I want to test scenarios, rather than changes in address. It also teaches me to update snapshots without looking. 

My tests will fail every time when I change the code even scenarios working properly, so I can‚Äôt be sure about why it‚Äôs failed and should validate it manually. It‚Äôs completely ok when I working with something simple, but when I work with some complex scenarios I want to code check and repeat that instead of me.

Does tact-example work correctly from the repo?  [#2186](https://t.me/tactlang/2186)
[2023-02-22T10:38:55] **Howard**: I made a mistake in my code that took me two days to figure out. I was using the == operator instead of = to assign a value to a variable, but the code still compiled without any errors.

The == operator is used for equality comparisons, not assignments. The correct operator for assignment is =.

Here's an example of the mistake I made:
self.status_A == 3; // üî¥ 
self.status_A = 3; // ‚úÖ


So, if you're assigning a value to a variable, make sure to use a single = sign, not ==. ü•∂üòÇ  [#2185](https://t.me/tactlang/2185)
[2023-02-21T19:43:45] **Howard**: There are multiple Tx records, and let's say I want to fetch the address from the "to" field of the first "sequo" number.

[2023-02-16T15:37:48] **Andrew**: there are several ways to update data: 

1. Provide migrated data with new code 
- for this your contract should support seqno (before code update)  to be sure that latest data will be updated 
- data should be migrated offchain and provided for contract 

This method has the disadvantage that any data can be set. Because can be modifyed in any way (e.g. adding or deliting some data outside of migration logic)

2. Contract should support some predefined instruction for modifying data before new code will be set.

3.  I‚Äôm not sure if it possible to send some migration code in Func or Fift that will be executed while migration.  [#2085](https://t.me/tactlang/2085)

[2023-02-16T12:11:22] **Kon Vik**: you can compare hash. Convert the value to slice and then apply .hash() - for example for string it will work... but if have Int - you can use math expressions even, what is the problem? You can compare:
let a: Int = 1;
let b: Int = 2;
if (a != b) {
...
}
If you mean the question how to pass through the map, then use index for map length + loop, then into loop use map.get(key) and compare  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2067](https://t.me/tactlang/2067)) [#2070](https://t.me/tactlang/2070)

[2023-02-16T11:41:36] **Alex Golev**: If values are slice_data, as I saw in FunC, it is compered via hash functions.

For instance, I encountered an error when I attempted to transfer the NFT on TonKeeper after I minted it.

That's why I had to deploy the contract and test it in production, checking and adding more 'if' cases to account for scenarios such as what would happen if the "forwardPayload" was empty or zero.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1915](https://t.me/tactlang/1915)) [#2017](https://t.me/tactlang/2017)

[2023-02-12T15:39:08] **Alex Golev**: As I understand, your NFT items have no store toncoins for itself, doesn‚Äôt it?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2008](https://t.me/tactlang/2008)) [#2010](https://t.me/tactlang/2010)
[2023-02-12T15:27:20] **Alex Golev**: Need check, do you have any testnet wallet address for sending NFT?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2005](https://t.me/tactlang/2005)) [#2009](https://t.me/tactlang/2009)
[2023-02-12T13:19:32] **Howard**: Yeh. But you can change it for sure. If your NFT content in metadata is not followed the index_id  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2006](https://t.me/tactlang/2006)) [#2008](https://t.me/tactlang/2008)
[2023-02-12T13:18:06] **Alex Golev**: Ok, give me some time, I will try send from Howard's repo and add there if I get success.  [#2007](https://t.me/tactlang/2007)
[2023-02-12T13:17:03] **Maksim**: so individual content suffix builds only in get_nft_data()?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2000](https://t.me/tactlang/2000)) [#2006](https://t.me/tactlang/2006)
[2023-02-12T13:16:07] **Maksim**: it‚Äôs not really matter you can send any example)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [2001](https://t.me/tactlang/2001)) [#2005](https://t.me/tactlang/2005)
[2023-02-12T13:15:53] **Howard**: Yes. I only test it out on TonKeeper for transfer.  [#2004](https://t.me/tactlang/2004)
[2023-02-12T13:15:30] **Howard**: I haven't tried out this yet. But good to try.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1999](https://t.me/tactlang/1999)) [#2003](https://t.me/tactlang/2003)
[2023-02-12T13:14:54] **Howard**: Good question! In fact, I tested it out and enable to put as a input that your users can put. 


For example, maybe it could be text message or the ID in the game, so it could plug-inon-chain rather than on the Metadata level(in JSON). 

That's why we keep custom_playload with question marks.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1996](https://t.me/tactlang/1996)) [#2002](https://t.me/tactlang/2002)
[2023-02-12T13:12:30] **Alex Golev**: I have no ready-made example for NFT transfer, trying to find an example.
I did several custom messages for my demo projects with ton library. Which library do you want to use?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1999](https://t.me/tactlang/1999)) [#2001](https://t.me/tactlang/2001)
[2023-02-12T13:11:37] **Howard**: I just followed the index_id as a parameters, to follow the metadata URL want to implement.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1993](https://t.me/tactlang/1993)) [#2000](https://t.me/tactlang/2000)
[2023-02-12T13:07:41] **Maksim**: so how i create transactions when we have custom messages receivers  [#1999](https://t.me/tactlang/1999)
[2023-02-12T13:06:59] **Maksim**: yeah  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1997](https://t.me/tactlang/1997)) [#1998](https://t.me/tactlang/1998)
[2023-02-12T13:05:49] **Alex Golev**: As I know Howard tested it with Tonkeeper. Do you want to create such a transaction via code?  [#1997](https://t.me/tactlang/1997)
[2023-02-12T13:03:33] **Maksim**: and one more question how do i form cutom messages like this  [#1996](https://t.me/tactlang/1996)
[2023-02-12T13:01:37] **Maksim**: so it builds in get_nft_data()?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1994](https://t.me/tactlang/1994)) [#1995](https://t.me/tactlang/1995)
[2023-02-12T13:00:18] **Alex Golev**: So, it is true, that individual NFTitem content is built here.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1987](https://t.me/tactlang/1987)) [#1994](https://t.me/tactlang/1994)
[2023-02-12T12:58:42] **Alex Golev**: Yeah, this place really tricky for me.
1) "Mint" message Invokes mint() function 
2) mint() invokes init() for creating data for new NFTItem here 
2) init() use getter getNftItemInit() for creating Individual content here
3) getNftItemInit() invokes get_nfr_data() individual content from here.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1991](https://t.me/tactlang/1991)) [#1993](https://t.me/tactlang/1993)
[2023-02-12T12:40:57] **Alex Golev**: Ah, sorry, I said it on-chain. I was wrong.üôà  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1986](https://t.me/tactlang/1986)) [#1992](https://t.me/tactlang/1992)
[2023-02-12T12:24:01] **Maksim**: i mean we have basic link for collection which we define in deploy.ts but where we define nft individual content suffix  [#1991](https://t.me/tactlang/1991)
[2023-02-12T12:22:23] **Maksim**: but when we mint nft we just send to the contract ‚ÄúMint‚Äù comment and don‚Äôt specify content for nft. so how it creates?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1989](https://t.me/tactlang/1989)) [#1990](https://t.me/tactlang/1990)
[2023-02-12T12:07:06] **Alex Golev**: It's implementation of reading. 
Content creates in this snippet.
+
Part of the implementation for the generation nft_item's content is placed in NFTitem init() function.

[2023-02-12T11:59:52] **Maksim**: there is a link in deploy.ts https://s.getgems.io/nft-staging/c/628f6ab8077060a7a8d52d63/ but for each nft {nft_index}.json adds to this link. so where we define this {nft_index}.json?

[2023-02-11T13:01:09] **Andrew**: Most difficult part yet is understanding TLB. 

Documentation said that is advanced and low-level, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to write something more difficult than counter without understanding it. 

Documentation itself written at the same level of difficulty.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1970](https://t.me/tactlang/1970)) [#1972](https://t.me/tactlang/1972)

[2023-02-11T11:57:07] **Alex Golev**: It is bad idea, you shouldn't use both of them in one project. 
If you tell more about your current issue somebody can help you use one library for all features in project.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1962](https://t.me/tactlang/1962)) [#1963](https://t.me/tactlang/1963)

[2023-02-05T07:02:20] **Howard**: From a security perspective, does that mean that "if I don't share my .tact file, no one can find bugs in my code?"

- The .ts file helps us interact with the smart contract without getting our hands dirty, as it is generated from the compiled output. It's not possible to reverse engineer the original logic of the code, similar to the .byte code in Solidity.

- To ensure that the receive method is not being called by anyone, it is correct to add as many require statements as possible. However, this may increase gas costs. I am currently unable to determine the difference as I have only tested on the test-net.  [#1863](https://t.me/tactlang/1863)

[2023-02-04T14:40:09] **Steve Korshakov**: tact by default bounces unknown messages, but there is a receiver bounced(msg: Slice) that allow to handle bounced messages  [#1839](https://t.me/tactlang/1839)
[2023-02-04T14:24:47] **Alex Golev**: Maybe my thoughts will be helpful:

I saw two cases in general in FunC contracts:
1) Messages bounced back if it something not expected by contract with funds - fees value. It's good practice and user friendly.
2) Messages just deliver to the destination contract, and then contract won't do any actions.

I'm not sure, what the current logic for the Tact compiler in general, but when I sent in testnet something unexpected by recievers it's just bounced back. It look like, all messages(op-codes) we not expected with receivers bounced.

And you can try send any opcode via ton library.

here not the bestüòÖ example of how to put opcode in Cell msg:

 //TL-B mint#01fb345b amount:int257 = Mint
    let msg = beginCell().storeBuffer(Buffer.from("01fb345b", "hex")).storeInt(amount, 257).endCell();  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1836](https://t.me/tactlang/1836)) [#1838](https://t.me/tactlang/1838)

https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-nft-standard

- There are example URIs for the image content, so you can change it to whatever you need! It's an off-chain content following the TEP64 metadata.

- For the minting process, you need to know that the is_initialized field is defined when the contract is deployed. Once the Item is being minted, it should change to true. (TEP-62)

- The Royalties Fee part has also been successfully implemented following TEP-66; it is now set to a default of 35% in the deploy.ts file. You can change it to whatever you want.  [#1818](https://t.me/tactlang/1818)

[2023-02-02T00:19:15] **Steve Korshakov**: Tact v0.9.0

This release is significantly improves gas usage and compatibility with func by allowing importing func files into your Tact contract!

This line would append contents of this file to the begining of Tact-generated file:

import "./native.fc";

Then you can declare native functions in tact that uses your func code.

Some caveats: func imports are not supported, order of imports are not guaranteed, func syntax is not verified (this could lead to cryptic errors), type safety is reduced and you have to be careful with declaring native functions in tact.

[2023-02-02T00:19:15] **Steve Korshakov**: I just added importing func code, that could help you writing something in plain func and keep working mostly in Tact. For example, you can create a jetton/nft content cell as you wish.  [#1812](https://t.me/tactlang/1812)

The only way I think possible is writing a for loop read each line of data in the mapping.

And I believe, that most part of users just want to swipe off transaction's push notify(if it's not about the incoming huge amountsüëÄü§©) and almost never look at their transaction's history.

Please, note, that I have practical experience only in realizing smart contracts for learning purposes and never realized my own product for TON. 
From what I know about classic development, I see following ways:

1) To make own Web client(mobile/desktop). That will display your contract's with UI you want. Something like a blockchain explorer adapted to your contract and viewing that's content according to your idea.

2) To create something like(or exactly the same) NFT item. Users can see this on their wallets from blockchain explorers and some wallets. You can try to implement your updates via NFT-editable. 
For example, GetGem's Easter eggs event was implemented with NFT. I tested it, and I've never got any notifications in the blockchain. But I have a lot in the telegram bot or in their marketplace. Another thing is that I could open my wallet when I wanted and check the "status" of my egg.

That's what I meant, hope it looks more clear for now.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1796](https://t.me/tactlang/1796)) [#1800](https://t.me/tactlang/1800)

[2023-01-25T08:48:36] **Howard**: I am building a notification for users who win a prize. However, there is a limitation for single transaction cost in TVM (1 TON). 

My question is, how many messages can I send to 100+ wallet addresses without incurring additional gas costs? 

*I am unable to test this in test libraries and cannot generate 100+ addresses on the test-net at this moment. If you know how to achieve this, let me know.  [#1623](https://t.me/tactlang/1623)

[2023-01-25T00:06:50] **Steve Korshakov**: Btw there are an example wallet-opt that do some mangling of slices that could work for you, but I recommend not to play around with cryptic code with slices, but just use structs and messages  [#1617](https://t.me/tactlang/1617)

[2023-01-25T00:03:52] **Steve Korshakov**: It is toCell, since it is not a cast but a costly operation  [#1615](https://t.me/tactlang/1615)
[2023-01-25T00:02:59] **Andrew**: what the best way to write next code in Tact? 


cell msg_body_cell = begin_cell().store_slice(in_msg_body).end_cell();

 var msg = begin_cell()
    .store_uint(0x10, 6)
    .store_slice(owner_address)
    .store_coins(0)
    .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)
    .store_slice(sender_address)
    .store_ref(msg_body_cell)
    .end_cell();
  send_raw_message(msg, 64);


I rewrote it like this, based on this example https://docs.tact-lang.org/guides/send#send-typed-message


struct Responce {
    sender: Address;
    msg: Slice;
}

 send(SendParameters{
                to: to,
                value: 0, 
                mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors, 
                bounce: true, 
                body: Responce{sender: ctx.sender, msg: msg}.asCell()
            });


However getting the same error: 


Error: Line 34, col 23:
  33 |                 bounce: true, 
> 34 |                 body: Responce{sender: ctx.sender, msg: msg}.asCell()
                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  35 |             });
Type "Responce" does not have a function named "asCell"

[2023-01-24T22:10:04] **Steve Korshakov**: Because it is error prone and better to use automated solutions  [#1613](https://t.me/tactlang/1613)
[2023-01-24T22:09:38] **Andrew**: why are you advising that? What's the issue with builders?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1611](https://t.me/tactlang/1611)) [#1612](https://t.me/tactlang/1612)
[2023-01-24T22:07:22] **Steve Korshakov**: this would be updated in next release, but i am advising against using builders at all  [#1611](https://t.me/tactlang/1611)
[2023-01-24T21:15:18] **Andrew**: Hello, just trying to use storeSlice according to docs https://docs.tact-lang.org/reference/cells#builderstoreslice

How I expect it should work (case 1): 

let message: Cell = beginCell().storeSlice(msg).endCell();


Actual result: 


Error: Line 28, col 33:
  27 |             let to: Address = self.owner;
> 28 |             let message: Cell = beginCell().storeSlice(msg).endCell();
                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  29 | 
Type "Builder" does not have a function named "storeSlice"


How it works instead:

let builder: Builder = beginCell();
builder = storeSlice(builder, msg);
let message: Cell = endCell(builder);


Is it expected behavior in case 1 or what I‚Äôm doing wrong? maybe it's a bug

e.g. msg.asCell() works as expected.  [#1610](https://t.me/tactlang/1610)
[2023-01-24T14:29:25] **Alex Golev**: Can anybody else try to deploy jetton.tact. I'm not sure we have problem in Tact compiler, but really stuck with this issue.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1581](https://t.me/tactlang/1581)) [#1609](https://t.me/tactlang/1609)
[2023-01-24T13:03:38] **Howard**: What I mean is for the big project that will bind the call methods to create the new contract like NFT Collection -> NFT Item contract.


1/ [Red square] if I build the new It statement, the variable of owner will change in a new one. 

How to keep the single address as owner and keep the authority all the time.


2/ [Orange square] the first contract's "New" statement will pass the message to my UserRecord contract(the second one); I will need to keep the parameters and status to track contract 1&2's reactions. 

Since I will get the reply message from Contract 2 sending to contract 1. 

My question is, how can we track those series of messages trigged by this Tx?

ContractA: receive(A) ‚Äî calling to --> ContractB: receive(the A plus)  ‚Äî calling to ‚Äî> ContractA: receive("any feedback message") 


3/ How we fetch the balance of the contract all the time(like monitoring each Txs cost, and the remaining balance for an address)


Since I always tested in production test net, now I am facing the issue that the contract might fail ‚Äúat some times‚Äù but works successfully by chance. (Yes, the opCode is the same, but the result might be failed based on different sizes of TON) This is why I am researching how to write proper test cases.  [#1607](https://t.me/tactlang/1607)
[2023-01-24T11:53:32] **Steve Korshakov**: So, just create a second tracker?  [#1606](https://t.me/tactlang/1606)
[2023-01-24T11:44:26] **Howard**: Sorry, more clarification. What should I do for multi-calling? 

My structure is that the one receive method in contract A will call to a second contract. And for now, it doesn't show on the Snapshot area.

It would be great if you could share the test cases in Jetton Standard b/c it us a mutil contact structure as well.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1604](https://t.me/tactlang/1604)) [#1605](https://t.me/tactlang/1605)

[2023-01-23T06:18:41] **Howard**: Example, I think there has something similar part we can use:

Left: My new module for test libraries - SandBox 
Right: The output TS file from Tact - by @Steve_kite  [#1573](https://t.me/tactlang/1573)
[2023-01-23T05:57:02] **Howard**: I think Tact compiler can integrate it by just change a bit for output file?Then everyone can benefit from that without rewriting modules for test themself again and again.  [#1572](https://t.me/tactlang/1572)
[2023-01-23T05:46:38] **Howard**: Hi all, has anyone tried to implement the TypeScript (TS) file we got after compiling in the SandBox?

Like this line it was routed from the contracts folder that we wrote previously.

I think what he did is exactly what we have already in the output folder.  [#1571](https://t.me/tactlang/1571)

@steve_kite can You suggest how to solve this issue?  [#1559](https://t.me/tactlang/1559)
[2023-01-22T14:24:07] **Alex Golev**: It depends on what you declared in contract.deploy.ts. 
The address will not change if you have no unique updated data in init() function.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1556](https://t.me/tactlang/1556)) [#1558](https://t.me/tactlang/1558)
[2023-01-22T14:19:14] **Howard**: nah, I mean those modules in contract folders in contract
https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox/tree/main/examples/contracts

are the export modules that we should write ourself? To define the script we want to test, right?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1555](https://t.me/tactlang/1555)) [#1557](https://t.me/tactlang/1557)
[2023-01-22T14:16:26] **Maksim**: i have one more question: why when i run contract.deploy.ts for several times for the same contract it generates the same address for the contract? shouldn't address be new every time i run contract.deploy.ts?  [#1556](https://t.me/tactlang/1556)
[2023-01-22T14:11:47] **Alex Golev**: export is ordinary js/ts keyword for modules. You can include(import) functions you need from another module, files in this way.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1552](https://t.me/tactlang/1552)) [#1555](https://t.me/tactlang/1555)

[2023-01-22T14:06:43] **Howard**: Checking in test-library, should we write the  export ourself for test initially??  [#1552](https://t.me/tactlang/1552)
[2023-01-22T14:06:11] **Alex Golev**: I think for Cell, Slice we should use hash() function to compare them(inherits from FunC). But, I‚Äôm not sure about the idea of how it should work in Tact.  [#1551](https://t.me/tactlang/1551)
[2023-01-22T14:05:52] **Howard**: if you want to do the comparison in Int, why don't you using Int still?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1549](https://t.me/tactlang/1549)) [#1550](https://t.me/tactlang/1550)

[2023-01-22T04:15:41] **Howard**: Put it as Slice data type first. The do the comparison. 

Or put String to Cell, by using ‚ÄúText‚Äù.asComment()  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1542](https://t.me/tactlang/1542)) [#1545](https://t.me/tactlang/1545)

Invalid type "String" for binary operator "=="
how should i check strings for equality?  [#1542](https://t.me/tactlang/1542)
[2023-01-21T19:45:05] **Howard**: How we can trouble shooting the error happened with ErrorCode5? 

Since it "sometimes" shows up in my contract......  [#1537](https://t.me/tactlang/1537)
[2023-01-21T06:44:15] **Howard**: anyone building the project in latest test library tho? I am not TS expert but learning on it ü§£


Otherwise I can only test the contract in test-net manually, it is not reliable for edge cases I think.  [#1535](https://t.me/tactlang/1535)

[2023-01-20T17:24:57] **Eugene Trifonov**: There is a small typo that might confuse someone on the new docs website ‚Äî missing "r" in "yarn"

I wanted to send a pull request to fix that, but the docs I see on GitHub differ from the docs I see on the new website, why is that?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1525](https://t.me/tactlang/1525)) [#1530](https://t.me/tactlang/1530)

[2023-01-20T17:14:10] **Alex Golev**: Actually from definition of SendParameters, 
it's not necessary to declare mode = 0:
struct SendParameters {
    bounce: Bool = true;
    to: Address;
    value: Int;
    mode: Int = 0;
    body: Cell? = null;
    code: Cell? = null;
    data: Cell? = null;
}

About your result, maybe need to create separate contract to check sending message with mode=0. I think it will work fine.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1524](https://t.me/tactlang/1524)) [#1528](https://t.me/tactlang/1528)

Because I tested in SendPayGasSeparately already, it seems not what I want neither what he mentioned there. 

Seems out of my knowledge or just Tact haven't implement yet.  [#1520](https://t.me/tactlang/1520)
[2023-01-20T16:44:45] **Howard**: Hi @steve_kite, have we implement same feature in Tact? Sorry, not the expert in FunC  [#1519](https://t.me/tactlang/1519)

[2023-01-20T13:54:32] **Howard**: Question: How do we measure the gas cost in the string type on body field? 

Is it gas costly? I think I want to send the message to all accounts that hit lucky numbers tho.  [#1513](https://t.me/tactlang/1513)
[2023-01-20T13:53:32] **Howard**: OK, I crossed the issued there, I took the example and gave a buffer that in there.  [#1512](https://t.me/tactlang/1512)
[2023-01-20T11:38:28] **Howard**: Yes, I have more feedback on this. 

I am currently dealing with transferring multiple addresses in a single transaction. It can be difficult to predict the current balance that the Vault contract still has. 

This can make it challenging to work with, especially if we are dealing with a Staking or Vault contract that needs to calculate a fee share. 

I highly recommend that we include a syntax in the standard libraries that shows the balance of TON that a contract has (after the current message and subtracting storage fees, etc.).  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1328](https://t.me/tactlang/1328)) [#1511](https://t.me/tactlang/1511)
[2023-01-20T10:47:16] **Alex Golev**: @steve_kite could you please add ‚Äútact-hello-world‚Äù branch in tact-template? I want to push a special version of tact-template there. In this version contact.tact will be empty and need to be restored with Tact hello-world guide.  [#1510](https://t.me/tactlang/1510)
[2023-01-20T03:08:57] **Howard**: should we update in Tact-template?  [#1509](https://t.me/tactlang/1509)
[2023-01-20T03:08:45] **Howard**: @ton-community/tx-emulator has been rebranded into @ton-community/sandbox and significantly improved!

It now uses the new ton-core under the hood and is compatible with all the APIs that it provides, making the creation of smart contract wrappers easier than ever!

More importantly though, the blockchain-experimental features have been merged, so you can now emulate whole chains of transactions and even emulate interactions with existing smart contracts from real networks (both mainnet and testnet)!

Together with it we released another package, test-utils, which, along with the new features  of sandbox, significantly simplifies testing of systems of multiple smart contracts.

Check out the examples provided together with sandbox to see the intended way to use it.

Please note that this tool is still in beta, but we would love to hear any feedback from you!

Also, stay tuned for more detailed tutorials for using this tool!  [#1508](https://t.me/tactlang/1508)

[2023-01-19T18:28:57] **Howard**: I am thinking how to search a "unlimited" list in a mapping....
like member_index: map[Int]Address

If I wan to search an Address in the list, I have to use a do... statment. Which is not scalible since the search from 0, 1, 2...etc  [#1504](https://t.me/tactlang/1504)
[2023-01-19T14:40:36] **Anthony Tsivarev | TON**: Can you share the account name?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1502](https://t.me/tactlang/1502)) [#1503](https://t.me/tactlang/1503)
[2023-01-19T14:39:37] **Howard**: Is there a way to verify the legitimacy of people claiming to be from the TON Foundation?  [#1502](https://t.me/tactlang/1502)
[2023-01-19T09:15:13] **Howard**: Sharing the code I tried to build for lottery for these two days:

1) It included the if... else if statment in practice.
2) It included some  do... until statment in practice.
3) It included the mapping in practice with set get
4) It included some "ABCDEFG".asComment()  in usage. 
5) It included the usage for randomInt()

I have identified that it is not efficient to send text messages and move the prize in the same transaction, as it is not predictable for the gas cost. I was using a constant number for it, but it seems that this is not a good approach.

Please note:
1) If you want to trigger two 'Send' methods in one 'Receive' method job, you should not add 'bounce: false'. The second 'Send' method will not be triggered if you do so.

2) The code still has many bugs and not perfect. Just sharing it for community.  [#1500](https://t.me/tactlang/1500)
[2023-01-18T17:34:03] **Howard**: is there any merkle root I can use to store User List? Like the example here?
https://github.com/a16z/eth-testnet-drop

1/ In EVM, the gas cost is so high. So one of the solution is that we only store the merkle root to save the spaces we need on-chain.

2/ We don't have array in Tact, then how we can store a list that with Users Addresses' data? And search, calling it each by each?


I am thinking to use the Collection+Item design like NFTs. Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks...  [#1499](https://t.me/tactlang/1499)
[2023-01-18T13:43:04] **Daniil Sedov**: even if I have defined some Message, I still need to serialize it myself with Builder to use in send(), right?
wouldn't it be easier for people to do like this?:
send(SendParameters{
    bounce: ...,
    to: ...,
    value: ...,
    mode: ...,
    body: MyMessage{
        someField1: ...,
        someField2: ...

[2023-01-18T13:07:41] **Howard**: And after I testing the code in many hours, you can't with multiple context like this:

mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors  + SendRemainingBalance ‚ùå

mode: SendIgnoreErrors  + SendRemainingBalance ‚úÖ
mode: SendIgnoreErrors  + SendRemainingValue  ‚úÖ  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1329](https://t.me/tactlang/1329)) [#1481](https://t.me/tactlang/1481)
[2023-01-18T13:06:01] **Steve Korshakov**: you need data and code that was at the moment of freeze, so it is impossible to infer from just contract code  [#1480](https://t.me/tactlang/1480)
[2023-01-18T13:05:40] **Steve Korshakov**: code and data from initOf won't work  [#1479](https://t.me/tactlang/1479)
[2023-01-18T13:05:29] **Daniil Sedov**: You don't need to send that every time  [#1478](https://t.me/tactlang/1478)
[2023-01-18T13:05:23] **Daniil Sedov**: Only if it's frozen  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1475](https://t.me/tactlang/1475)) [#1477](https://t.me/tactlang/1477)
[2023-01-18T13:05:14] **Steve Korshakov**: yes, higher  [#1476](https://t.me/tactlang/1476)
[2023-01-18T13:04:53] **Howard**: Yes, but then my SendParameters will always need with code and data that will make Gas Cost higher or no?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1473](https://t.me/tactlang/1473)) [#1475](https://t.me/tactlang/1475)
[2023-01-18T13:03:43] **Howard**: then maybe we should implement msgValue in a standard that I can set 0.001 TON for a contract?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1472](https://t.me/tactlang/1472)) [#1474](https://t.me/tactlang/1474)
[2023-01-18T13:02:49] **Daniil Sedov**: If it's frozen, you still can recover it by sending a message with code and data to it  [#1473](https://t.me/tactlang/1473)
[2023-01-18T13:02:45] **Steve Korshakov**: you can unfreeze contract by sending state init data with latest known data and code, but this could be challenging to recover  [#1472](https://t.me/tactlang/1472)
[2023-01-18T13:02:15] **Steve Korshakov**: balance would be zero, depending on the size of a contract in a months it would be frozen and things would be complicated, eventually in years it would be deleted  [#1471](https://t.me/tactlang/1471)
[2023-01-18T13:00:48] **Howard**: the functions totally can't be called or? What is the definition for it?

I am sure I can send Tx anytime to the contract tho.  [#1470](https://t.me/tactlang/1470)
[2023-01-18T13:00:22] **Daniil Sedov**: It'll be frozen  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1468](https://t.me/tactlang/1468)) [#1469](https://t.me/tactlang/1469)
[2023-01-18T12:59:44] **Howard**: I know it's a non-Tact question but: What will it happen for the smart contract if we using SendRemainingBalance to let the balance of an "active" smart contract balance being zero? 

#storageFee, Fee Calculate  [#1468](https://t.me/tactlang/1468)
[2023-01-18T11:57:01] **Steve Korshakov**: It would be fixed in next releases, this is just the most ancient part of stdlib  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1463](https://t.me/tactlang/1463)) [#1467](https://t.me/tactlang/1467)
[2023-01-18T11:43:12] **Steve Korshakov**: If someone knows textmate grammars it would be nice to have tact one since it is a common format for web highlighters  [#1466](https://t.me/tactlang/1466)
[2023-01-18T11:13:42] **Kon Vik**: We are working on VScode extension for Tact, in 2-4 weeks will be released, we hope...  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1437](https://t.me/tactlang/1437)) [#1465](https://t.me/tactlang/1465)
[2023-01-18T10:27:23] **Daniil Sedov**: also strange that empty message structures are forbidden  [#1464](https://t.me/tactlang/1464)
[2023-01-18T10:14:52] **Daniil Sedov**: why I can't make a cell like this:
beginCell().storeUint(1, 32).endCell()
and only like this:
endCell(storeUint(beginCell(), 1, 32))

it's actually painful to make cells that way...  [#1463](https://t.me/tactlang/1463)
[2023-01-18T09:59:11] **Daniil Sedov**: so we can just compare with null  [#1462](https://t.me/tactlang/1462)
[2023-01-18T09:59:09] **Howard**: But assume the easier way for me, I will using if.  [#1461](https://t.me/tactlang/1461)
[2023-01-18T09:59:06] **Daniil Sedov**: oh I actually found this example in repo  [#1460](https://t.me/tactlang/1460)
[2023-01-18T09:58:46] **Howard**: But there also has another way I think using function, for example.  [#1459](https://t.me/tactlang/1459)
[2023-01-18T09:58:20] **Howard**: Yes  [#1458](https://t.me/tactlang/1458)
[2023-01-18T09:53:40] **Daniil Sedov**: so is my code snippet above is correct?
I just want to make something if there is no such key in map

let val: Int? = self.someMap.get(123);
if (VAL_NOT_FOUND) {
    // do something
}

how do I write it in tact?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1455](https://t.me/tactlang/1455)) [#1457](https://t.me/tactlang/1457)
[2023-01-18T09:52:20] **Howard**: but you will get compiler error in latest version if you wrote like this  [#1456](https://t.me/tactlang/1456)
[2023-01-18T09:50:51] **Howard**: highlight that it must have the value tho  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1454](https://t.me/tactlang/1454)) [#1455](https://t.me/tactlang/1455)
[2023-01-18T09:50:34] **Daniil Sedov**: what the !! operator does exactly? just checks if the value is null?  [#1454](https://t.me/tactlang/1454)
[2023-01-18T09:49:50] **Daniil Sedov**: right?  [#1453](https://t.me/tactlang/1453)
[2023-01-18T09:49:48] **Daniil Sedov**: okay, and then to check if the value is null, I just need to do:
let val: Int? = self.someMap.get(123);
if (!!val) {
    // is not null
} else {
    // is null
}  [#1452](https://t.me/tactlang/1452)
[2023-01-18T09:45:32] **Howard**: null


That is why you need signed a ? after the datatype  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1447](https://t.me/tactlang/1447)) [#1449](https://t.me/tactlang/1449)
[2023-01-18T09:45:16] **Howard**: thanks. #fee  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1445](https://t.me/tactlang/1445)) [#1448](https://t.me/tactlang/1448)
[2023-01-18T09:44:43] **Daniil Sedov**: I wanted to know what will happen if some key does not exist in map and I call m.get(key). Will it throw an error return null, or maybe something else?  [#1447](https://t.me/tactlang/1447)
[2023-01-18T09:43:45] **Daniil Sedov**: where are the docs for Map type? I didn't find any in repo  [#1446](https://t.me/tactlang/1446)

[2023-01-18T09:24:26] **Alex Golev**: It depends from time passed from last outgoing message. I think you need read about fees to understand how it works in TON.  [#1444](https://t.me/tactlang/1444)
[2023-01-18T09:22:03] **Howard**: in test-net it sometimes cost me:

- etc  [#1443](https://t.me/tactlang/1443)
[2023-01-18T09:20:51] **Howard**: What is the minimum TON I should prepare for sending a "Text message"?  [#1441](https://t.me/tactlang/1441)

[2023-01-17T10:48:29] **Howard**: Hi @steve_kite , is this a proper way to send a series of addresses?

[2023-01-17T10:29:41] **Steve Korshakov**: You are looking at the old tact, that was built using ocaml, new one is written in typescript and doesn‚Äôt have anything in common with old one and was designed from scratch  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1405](https://t.me/tactlang/1405)) [#1414](https://t.me/tactlang/1414)

Heard that using the method I did here, will only able to send with 253 accounts/messages?  [#1412](https://t.me/tactlang/1412)
[2023-01-17T05:13:11] **Howard**: Question: How we can multi-sending the transaction in Tact?

I mean it is based on Gas Cost right? Then I am trying like this: Building a Int => Address mapping list, and using do method to adding one my one to get receiver address.

But you know, it's unrealistic because the gas used is huge here. 

Anyone has better solution for this? Since we don't have array in Tact.  [#1409](https://t.me/tactlang/1409)

[2023-01-15T16:50:01] **Howard**: so best way is mode: SendRemainingBalance + SendIgnoreErrors? 

How about the difference in sort in order? Like mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingBalance  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1328](https://t.me/tactlang/1328)) [#1329](https://t.me/tactlang/1329)
[2023-01-15T16:14:10] **Steve Korshakov**: Balance includes value of incoming message and therefore always more than is available since it is before gas substraction  [#1328](https://t.me/tactlang/1328)
[2023-01-15T15:39:04] **Howard**: maybe using             mode: SendRemainingBalance + SendIgnoreErrors, is proper way  [#1327](https://t.me/tactlang/1327)
[2023-01-15T15:37:56] **Howard**: I implement this functions in empty receive() method, but contract will not do any since receive the TON. 

thinking myBalance() didn't work here  [#1326](https://t.me/tactlang/1326)
[2023-01-15T12:55:54] **Howard**: Since I am using a mapping to store a series of tier level for the users:

- I am using Int? since Tact@^0.7.0 requested. So to achieve the needs, I am using the !! since after the minRequirement.

But I will get the error no matter what.

What should I do to passed this?  [#1324](https://t.me/tactlang/1324)
[2023-01-15T07:31:59] **Howard**: anyone can share some testTON, I run out of it again. Please DM me.  [#1323](https://t.me/tactlang/1323)
[2023-01-15T06:35:35] **Howard**: Do not set the get function with a question mark, even though the NFT item address is predictable.

I think the question mark will cause the data set to take up more space in bits/cells, which may cause the original data you passed to the contract to be shifted.

For example, the owner_address we declared initially when deploying this collection contract.  [#1322](https://t.me/tactlang/1322)
[2023-01-15T04:57:26] **Howard**: It sounds foolish, but it actually happened! I initially pointed the owner address to my wallet address when deploying the Collection contract, but for some reason, since I read the contract status, it stored the wrong wallet address (i.e. an unknown type of address).

After thinking for a while and testing for hours, I am assuming that even though I put the initial code, the TVM might have caught and stored the wrong address. It is beyond my understanding.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1316](https://t.me/tactlang/1316)) [#1321](https://t.me/tactlang/1321)
[2023-01-15T04:54:51] **Howard**: I am still debugging which part of the initial code I pointed to the contract is causing issues.

There are still some type check errors. I think I may have triggered an edge case for Tact, as it is able to compile the code even with errors present.

Some errors will only show up with an Exit Code 7, while others don't.

Additionally, some errors cause the wrong address to be stored in the contract status.  [#1320](https://t.me/tactlang/1320)
[2023-01-14T20:03:55] **Alex Golev**: Well, I think you could get the same address but in another form. Could you resend here your address in text or link, I want to take a look too.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1317](https://t.me/tactlang/1317)) [#1319](https://t.me/tactlang/1319)
[2023-01-14T20:02:08] **Alex Golev**: Since I successfully deployed wallet.tact, I think we have no such issue. wallet.tact (in the compiled version) is big enough too.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1314](https://t.me/tactlang/1314)) [#1318](https://t.me/tactlang/1318)
[2023-01-14T20:02:03] **Howard**: I mean, since I deployed this collection contract, using get function to get owner_address was different with the initial I put in. Even I didn't do any change for this owner parameter.  [#1317](https://t.me/tactlang/1317)
[2023-01-14T20:00:50] **Howard**: can we hardcoded the owner_address initially? 

because like the example here I put for owner address, will change after I deploy the code (seems the contract didn't catch correctly even I send the right format of wallet address)  [#1316](https://t.me/tactlang/1316)
[2023-01-14T19:57:32] **Alex Golev**: Can you resend the address of the collection?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1313](https://t.me/tactlang/1313)) [#1315](https://t.me/tactlang/1315)
[2023-01-14T19:56:09] **Howard**: for example, maybe the Tact line of code is too large or too many parameters in one contract. Can't sure.  [#1314](https://t.me/tactlang/1314)
[2023-01-14T19:55:37] **Howard**: now, owner_address was the initial wallet address I gave for the Collection Address.


But the owner_address just changed since after I deployed the code and read on-chain data, it just fallback a totally different address. 

I am assume that the code got shift since after we compile successfully.  [#1313](https://t.me/tactlang/1313)
[2023-01-14T19:52:36] **Alex Golev**: I used Address object, shift via Address.parse(); But it seems to work equally.

Did I understand correctly, your owner is another smart contract(wallet?) deployed earlier?  [#1312](https://t.me/tactlang/1312)
[2023-01-14T19:43:20] **Howard**: Thinking might be some shift for the address?  [#1311](https://t.me/tactlang/1311)
[2023-01-14T19:38:04] **Howard**: I am using testAddress libraries in "ton-emulator"  [#1310](https://t.me/tactlang/1310)
[2023-01-14T19:19:02] **Alex Golev**: That code repeats what we do in tact-template. From this side, I didn‚Äôt meet any issues with changing owner‚Äôs Addresses. In the deployed contract I got the exact owner, that I specified in init() function.

Which way did you calculate your owner address when deploying your contract?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1308](https://t.me/tactlang/1308)) [#1309](https://t.me/tactlang/1309)
[2023-01-14T18:54:00] **Howard**: is it possible that the input address will change the format since after we put as input initially?  [#1308](https://t.me/tactlang/1308)
[2023-01-14T18:25:36] **Howard**: I noticed when I using Send method with an address I assigned before can't receive the funds. 

For example, like this: self.owner_address were the initial input I put in. But it some how router to an Unknown wallet address!

If I use TonHub address as an input setting initially, this self.owner_address will be router to an unknown address (wired)  [#1307](https://t.me/tactlang/1307)
[2023-01-14T17:52:06] **Steve Korshakov**: But you can always do .toString(10) for both types  [#1306](https://t.me/tactlang/1306)
[2023-01-14T17:51:46] **Steve Korshakov**: New ton library works with bigint  [#1305](https://t.me/tactlang/1305)
[2023-01-14T17:50:24] **Alex Golev**: For wallet.tact example Tact compiler makes init function with Bigint arguments:
init(key: bigint, walletId: bigint) 

In the ton library, we are working with BN numbers. Can somebody advise, how can we use ton library to invoke init() function in this case? Cast BN to bigint or something else?  [#1304](https://t.me/tactlang/1304)

[2023-01-14T15:45:35] **Howard**: Hi, what is the usage or purpose for nativeReserve?

Because "to maintain" a contract alive, we need keep some TON in it for storage cost? 


Then what is this the difference we just set a constant number like here in Jetton standard as well?

[2023-01-14T08:46:48] **Howard**: yeh, I think there has some limitation for TonKeeper API now? Can't deploy contract properly if my initial code is too large still. 

Just will expired the loading time per Txs on TonKeeper? I can share the URL then let you try out tho.  [#1300](https://t.me/tactlang/1300)
[2023-01-14T06:09:48] **Howard**: Might be only because my initial code is too large?  [#1298](https://t.me/tactlang/1298)

[2023-01-13T11:47:06] **Seitaro Higuchi**: Well, if you have offchain metadata (via url) and each nft is unique, each nft should have it's own url. However, you can for instance store common prefix in collection like "myawesomecollection.ton/nfts/" and individual content will only contain suffix of each nft.
It is possible that you mixed two concepts:
collection metadata (metadata of collection as a whole set), one per collection,
nft metadata - one per item.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1265](https://t.me/tactlang/1265)) [#1278](https://t.me/tactlang/1278)

[2023-01-13T11:16:13] **Steve Korshakov**: The problem is that standard somehow requires non standard prefix of a single byte  [#1273](https://t.me/tactlang/1273)
[2023-01-13T11:14:57] **Howard**: how will you go next to implement this part? 

Append the URL (content) must using String or StringBuilder in Tact, right?  [#1272](https://t.me/tactlang/1272)
[2023-01-13T11:08:03] **Steve Korshakov**: Because it could store content on chain and you can change it if you wish  [#1271](https://t.me/tactlang/1271)
[2023-01-13T11:03:15] **Howard**: Yes, I mean, I already can put index input as a parameter to generate each NFTs' URL (based on index_id) 

Then why I need individual_content as a second parameter as an Input here?  [#1270](https://t.me/tactlang/1270)
[2023-01-13T11:01:04] **Daniil Sedov**: so they must have different URLs :)  [#1269](https://t.me/tactlang/1269)
[2023-01-13T11:00:59] **Daniil Sedov**: often people have collections where each NFT is an unique image  [#1268](https://t.me/tactlang/1268)

[2023-01-13T10:57:45] **Howard**: Since followed the TEP62 here, we have a get function called get_nft_content. Let's say we have the URL for Collection & NFT Item were as follows.


My question here is that, what is the individual_content means here? I might not want to prepare 10,000 different URL if I have  10,000 NFT Item in total.  [#1265](https://t.me/tactlang/1265)

Then send a second Send method. But no matter what I tried, still will get "Auction failed".

[2023-01-10T14:12:02] **Steve Korshakov**: The bounced message body has just first 256 bits of the original one  [#1195](https://t.me/tactlang/1195)
[2023-01-10T14:08:10] **Alex Golev**: I did a mistake in the description: we will send body to the sender who had sent a message to our contract(so dst of bounced message does not depends on the body).
So the message body will be according to what you placed there - comment or anything else.

About catching messages, as I understand if we want to do something special in the contract we need to specify our actions with opcodes. And something special, I mean some actions, that we will do after getting this. Technically we can define actions based on bounced messages, but it seems like bad behavior. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, everything I saw contracts just ignores bounced messages(recognized by flag). In my understanding bounce generally serves only for returning funds.

Maybe somebody knows an example, where we do some actions after bounced message gets?  [#1194](https://t.me/tactlang/1194)
[2023-01-10T13:50:54] **Howard**: - then that will bounced back to Contract A and rely on reply() method I designed in Contract A?

- What if I set a empty receive() in contract A as well? It's different, right? receive() is for any TON transfer with empty message.

But tx / message from a bounced situation is having the message inside, right?  [#1193](https://t.me/tactlang/1193)
[2023-01-10T13:48:43] **Daniil Sedov**: 2. Yes, in the contract A add some if-statement which will catch messages with bounced flag  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1190](https://t.me/tactlang/1190)) [#1192](https://t.me/tactlang/1192)
[2023-01-10T13:11:34] **Howard**: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/docs/stdlib.md

Kind of confuse for me when reading this part. Will like to fully understand how to use this standard method.  [#1191](https://t.me/tactlang/1191)
[2023-01-10T13:11:21] **Howard**: About some standard libraries:

1. since simpleSend converted to nativeSendMessage, it seems doesn't support with contract in default yet.


2. For reply() method call: what can we leverage in this for the bounced message about body? 

I mean if the body informations will bounced back, can we design a receive method to catch this error then do other behavior? (let's say ContractA -> Contract B (bounces the message) -> Contract A (catch the message) 

3. For the nativeReserve, there has only 3 usage in `Tact Example`, can we say that:
"If the mode is set to 0, the output action will reserve exactly the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 2, the output action will reserve at most the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 1 or 3, the output action will reserve all but the specified amount of nano-toncoins."  [#1189](https://t.me/tactlang/1189)

[2023-01-10T12:23:27] **Howard**: Can I say that the empty receive() method call are the way that set a default Txs once people send TON to the contract without "any" message or comment?  [#1186](https://t.me/tactlang/1186)
[2023-01-10T12:07:12] **Steve Korshakov**: May be yes  [#1185](https://t.me/tactlang/1185)
[2023-01-10T12:06:09] **datboi**: how will it be implemented? through external out messages?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1183](https://t.me/tactlang/1183)) [#1184](https://t.me/tactlang/1184)

[2023-01-10T11:24:27] **Howard**: is it has a way like Event in Solidity so I can keep track the data/value/status for the SmartContract I just interacted?  [#1182](https://t.me/tactlang/1182)

[2023-01-10T10:24:17] **Daniil Sedov**: I think in most cases it's fine, but sometimes you should think of something more complex  [#1180](https://t.me/tactlang/1180)
[2023-01-10T10:23:36] **Daniil Sedov**: Also note that it's not always safe to rely on the data that contract send you in a message. Its state may change while the message is on the way to the destination  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1178](https://t.me/tactlang/1178)) [#1179](https://t.me/tactlang/1179)
[2023-01-10T09:47:05] **Howard**: Oh. Now my code is like this: contract A ‚û°Ô∏è contract B ‚û°Ô∏è contract C. 

- It's fantastic to think of a new way to design the protocol architecture, especially since each contract can't know the contract status in any block height. 

- The way you want to track the data on the other contract is to let 'the current contract' send a message to the other and set a customized receive() method to send the transactions back with the status for this contract.  [#1178](https://t.me/tactlang/1178)

[2023-01-08T11:15:13] **Howard**: about Send Parameters, I know you can set the bounce message for funds back to previous sender. 

But is it possible that I can set, "if this txs failed, do X, Y or Z?"


Because I noticed if the Tx to NFT Item failed, it will only put the TON back to Collection contract. Which is not I want. 

I want to implement that any txs failed, go to this NFT Item owner. (Which more make sense for me  [#1172](https://t.me/tactlang/1172)

[2023-01-08T06:28:08] **Howard**: OK, find the issued. I got your point now.

Yes, for ^0.8.1, the data type you set in message field now can't with question mark '?' now.  [#1162](https://t.me/tactlang/1162)
[2023-01-08T06:19:47] **Steve Korshakov**: you declared a field with remaining modifier and made it optional, it is impossible combination  [#1161](https://t.me/tactlang/1161)
[2023-01-08T06:18:10] **Howard**: sorry, I don't understand. Is it any line of code wrong? Or just the disclaim of the data type was wrong in my code initially.  [#1160](https://t.me/tactlang/1160)
[2023-01-08T05:45:14] **Steve Korshakov**: it said what it said  [#1159](https://t.me/tactlang/1159)
[2023-01-08T05:36:51] **Howard**: got this error since only happend in @0.8.2.

There is no error to compile if I put Tact back to @0.7.1  [#1158](https://t.me/tactlang/1158)
[2023-01-08T05:16:41] **Howard**: This is super cool!  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1155](https://t.me/tactlang/1155)) [#1157](https://t.me/tactlang/1157)

[2023-01-08T04:33:54] **Steve Korshakov**: I just added deployment code that would open local link automatically without traveling to a browser: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template/commit/c775d220838ffc07f1c619adeda4ea4cec58ad4e  [#1155](https://t.me/tactlang/1155)
[2023-01-08T03:24:26] **Steve Korshakov**: Tonweb doesn‚Äôt have bindings supported, and rate limits and general instability or classical api is the reason we are using TonClien4  [#1154](https://t.me/tactlang/1154)
[2023-01-07T23:04:33] **Herm√®s**: üëç  [#1153](https://t.me/tactlang/1153)
[2023-01-07T22:38:40] **Howard**: Since I deployed the contract successfully, ExitCode 7 shows the TypeCheckError  [#1151](https://t.me/tactlang/1151)

[2023-01-07T21:57:17] **Howard**: Hi @steve_kite I am using the new suggest you asked. 

And it failed because I think I am using the library generated a new account that doesn't have TON in balance, right?  [#1137](https://t.me/tactlang/1137)
[2023-01-07T18:05:42] **Howard**: anyone got it? üòÖ ngmi  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1126](https://t.me/tactlang/1126)) [#1135](https://t.me/tactlang/1135)
[2023-01-07T18:03:46] **Howard**: once you compile you can find the packed that encoded in output folder. 

And based on message you define previously in .tact file, you can find them in there. 

And just copy / paste based the message data type you got.  [#1134](https://t.me/tactlang/1134)
[2023-01-07T18:02:46] **Howard**: Example for the other contract.deploy.ts  [#1132](https://t.me/tactlang/1132)
[2023-01-07T17:59:39] **Howard**: it's just an Address data type and a Int data type  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1130](https://t.me/tactlang/1130)) [#1131](https://t.me/tactlang/1131)
[2023-01-07T16:41:56] **Alex Golev**: Thank you, this is clear part for me too. I want to see more specific examples for different cases. 
For example, in payouts.tact we should invoke init(address, public key) in payouts.deploy.ts.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1129](https://t.me/tactlang/1129)) [#1130](https://t.me/tactlang/1130)
[2023-01-07T16:29:24] **Howard**: Change Line 3, 10, based on the .ts file you got in output folder.

[2023-01-07T15:15:40] **Howard**: nope.... is there an example? Just need to solve the  initial contract code  [#1123](https://t.me/tactlang/1123)
[2023-01-07T15:14:32] **Steve Korshakov**: Have you tried to send a transaction via ton library directly?  [#1122](https://t.me/tactlang/1122)
[2023-01-07T15:13:33] **Howard**: Hi, can we help to solve the issued for URL too large?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1117](https://t.me/tactlang/1117)) [#1121](https://t.me/tactlang/1121)

[2023-01-07T13:12:46] **Steve Korshakov**: TACT reached feature and ABI freeze in 0.8.1

This is the last breaking release before 1.0.0. I expect compiler to have some possible bugs, but if you are testing your contracts you should be fine. I recommend it to early-stage production development. For example if you are going to release in a month-two, TACT is a good choise for you.

Changes:
* Dictionaries in typescript bindings
* You can now generate bindings for non-tact contracts by writing a specially formatted JSON file (we are welcome to contribute another ways to describe contracts!)
* Stable and predictable ABI that you can use in your explorers and apps to generate a UI for working with a smart contract

[2023-01-07T11:13:03] **Howard**: 3 major issues:

1. How to put string URL in Tact code for NFT content.

2. The deploy code is too large that can't deploy through TonKeeper

3. How to generate test cases from jest  [#1112](https://t.me/tactlang/1112)
[2023-01-07T09:45:23] **Howard**: how you got those? Can't find any description about this part in template repo üòÖ  [#1111](https://t.me/tactlang/1111)
[2023-01-07T09:44:30] **Steve Korshakov**: It is autogenerated by jest  [#1110](https://t.me/tactlang/1110)
[2023-01-07T09:43:19] **Howard**: Sorry, how we get those json part.... in test file?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [950](https://t.me/tactlang/950)) [#1109](https://t.me/tactlang/1109)
[2023-01-07T09:41:48] **Steve Korshakov**: You can use normal api and a library to send message the same way you are doing tests  [#1108](https://t.me/tactlang/1108)
[2023-01-07T09:40:52] **Howard**: so how I can deploy the code right now tho? Or I just learn how to write the test case right now first.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1106](https://t.me/tactlang/1106)) [#1107](https://t.me/tactlang/1107)
[2023-01-07T09:39:49] **Steve Korshakov**: Also you can just use ledger I am not sure if this is a feasible way to someone  [#1106](https://t.me/tactlang/1106)
[2023-01-07T09:39:23] **Steve Korshakov**: But I guess it could be done  [#1105](https://t.me/tactlang/1105)
[2023-01-07T09:39:12] **Steve Korshakov**: Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt want to make it default way to deploy even for development  [#1104](https://t.me/tactlang/1104)
[2023-01-07T09:38:22] **Howard**: oh, that make sense. Yeh, it's totally different than the way we developing on Solidity. 

Interacting with chain through Wallet then wouldn't need to store the key in the local .env file.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1101](https://t.me/tactlang/1101)) [#1103](https://t.me/tactlang/1103)

[2023-01-07T09:33:39] **datboi**: anyways, it‚Äôs trivial to send message, Tact compiler must give you StateInit code and data  [#1100](https://t.me/tactlang/1100)
[2023-01-07T09:32:17] **Steve Korshakov**: Please no tonweb here  [#1099](https://t.me/tactlang/1099)
[2023-01-07T09:31:51] **datboi**: why not? you just need to send a message with StateInit inside. i guess TypeScript has some libraries to send messages via API, such as tonweb  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1096](https://t.me/tactlang/1096)) [#1098](https://t.me/tactlang/1098)

[2023-01-07T09:28:57] **Howard**: can we deploy the conde through API as well in TypeScript?  [#1096](https://t.me/tactlang/1096)

[2023-01-05T19:57:10] **Alex Golev**: Hello, TON developers!üëã
Ready to step into the 2023 TON massive adoption year? Let‚Äôs do it with Tact!

TLDR

Tact is a high-level, scalable language designed to improve the usability of smart contract development for TON. If you've long wanted to dive into smart contract development, now is the time when you can start from the very basics as a Tact developer. Definitely, your participation will be especially appreciated if you are an experienced FunC developerü§ù.

The Tact language project was originally initiated in the summer of 2022 when the original concept was designed. 
In December 2022, the Tact compiler development continued, and currently work is in full swing.üåã


What next?

To improve the quality of the Tact compiler an important requestü•∫  to the great TON community is to play with the compiler according to the template project.  
If you will find a BIG problem with the Tact compiler itself, we will be very happy if you tell us about it in the chat or in git issues. Also, feel free to ask your questions Tact questions in chat. 

If you have any questions about the Tact documentation DM me @iftryalexg  - I will disclose all questions ASAP in the documentation or answer you with a link that helps you.ü§ì  [#1075](https://t.me/tactlang/1075)

[2023-01-05T13:48:22] **Roman Krutovoy**: Dear developers, üëã 

I'm Roman, a Developer Onboarding Manager at TON Foundation.

Recently, TON Footstep about Tact documentation was launched. @iftryalexg made a structure for future documentation and will implement it. 

We aim to make the best documentation we can in an open and transparent way with help of community.

üÜî Everyone is welcome to read the documentation plan in the ton-foostep:

https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/105

If any questions about documentation, this chat is the best place for discussion and continuous improvement. 

The most valuable contribution would be:
- which examples of using Tact do you lack?
- what guides for Tact do we need first?
- documentation plan improvements?

Let's build the future of TON together! üíé  [#1048](https://t.me/tactlang/1048)
[2023-01-05T05:49:46] **Howard**: OK, this is the latest way to read contract data since after you compile successfully.  [#1046](https://t.me/tactlang/1046)
[2023-01-05T05:10:45] **Steve Korshakov**: again this is ton-nodejs it is deprecated and not going to work  [#1045](https://t.me/tactlang/1045)
[2023-01-05T05:10:13] **Howard**: Since I usually use createExecutorFromRemote to check the data. Now it's abandoned.  [#1044](https://t.me/tactlang/1044)
[2023-01-05T05:09:25] **Howard**: yeh, I just deployed on testnet and test it by fetching the data. Because I haven't familiar write in test at this moment.  [#1043](https://t.me/tactlang/1043)
[2023-01-05T05:07:32] **Steve Korshakov**: did you open contract?  [#1042](https://t.me/tactlang/1042)
[2023-01-05T05:06:54] **Howard**: really not a expert in TypeScript. Can we add an example for contract.read.ts again?

Try to fetch the data from my contract to verify the result.  [#1041](https://t.me/tactlang/1041)
[2023-01-05T04:44:18] **Howard**: this is a great topic. Interesting. I will try and implement like this. Thank you.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1032](https://t.me/tactlang/1032)) [#1040](https://t.me/tactlang/1040)
[2023-01-05T04:39:20] **Steve Korshakov**: btw on this openai screenshot it is just a reading function that you can emulate offchain, you have to do this in dapp itself  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1027](https://t.me/tactlang/1027)) [#1039](https://t.me/tactlang/1039)
[2023-01-05T04:38:16] **Steve Korshakov**: i welcome you to review what tact generates, it compiles to FunC  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1036](https://t.me/tactlang/1036)) [#1038](https://t.me/tactlang/1038)
[2023-01-05T04:35:29] **Lev Chizhov**: Probably, yeah  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1036](https://t.me/tactlang/1036)) [#1037](https://t.me/tactlang/1037)
[2023-01-05T04:35:10] **Howard**: recv_internal() in FunC is more like receive() method in Tact, right?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1032](https://t.me/tactlang/1032)) [#1036](https://t.me/tactlang/1036)
[2023-01-05T04:34:04] **Howard**: More like a game based on NFT. So people can transfer, sell it so on so for. And NFT itself also has the other value that I can track, fetch to offline and show on website so on so for.  [#1034](https://t.me/tactlang/1034)
[2023-01-05T04:33:16] **Howard**: I am trying to implement the own feature for the Dapp.... Thinking how I can solve this  [#1033](https://t.me/tactlang/1033)
[2023-01-05T04:33:02] **Lev Chizhov**: Ofc it depends on what you need to do, but I'd say it's kind of like this:
1. You do everything until you need to fetch the data
2. You save the intermediate variables (if you need) into the storage
3. You send the message with the request to the second item
4. You handle the response in recv_internal() by checking if a message is coming from the second item
5. You continue doing stuff with the information  [#1032](https://t.me/tactlang/1032)
[2023-01-05T04:30:52] **Lev Chizhov**: But the NFT standart has an op-code for getting the data, so you can send the message and then act on the reply from the second item  [#1031](https://t.me/tactlang/1031)
[2023-01-05T04:30:06] **Lev Chizhov**: Literally 1984  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1029](https://t.me/tactlang/1029)) [#1030](https://t.me/tactlang/1030)
[2023-01-05T04:28:47] **Steve Korshakov**: no data sharing in ton, only sending messages  [#1029](https://t.me/tactlang/1029)
[2023-01-05T04:10:53] **Howard**: I am trying to fetch data from Item 2 contract back to fetch 1 to do the comparison. 

Like here in Solidity  [#1027](https://t.me/tactlang/1027)
[2023-01-05T04:03:46] **Howard**: Hi guys, is there any way I can let NFT item 1 contract fetch data from NFT Item 2 in Tact? like this  [#1026](https://t.me/tactlang/1026)
[2023-01-05T02:57:47] **Howard**: üòÇ I need a cheat sheet. I just want to put a string append together tho  [#1025](https://t.me/tactlang/1025)
[2023-01-05T02:56:59] **Steve Korshakov**: no, how can you put a string into binary tree?  [#1024](https://t.me/tactlang/1024)
[2023-01-05T02:44:34] **Howard**: Yes, there has a way to put String in default for the content you can put initially. 

Using "String Here".asComment(); to put it as Cell.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1021](https://t.me/tactlang/1021)) [#1023](https://t.me/tactlang/1023)
[2023-01-05T02:40:25] **Howard**: This is the code that I am working on for NFT implementation on Tact.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1021](https://t.me/tactlang/1021)) [#1022](https://t.me/tactlang/1022)
[2023-01-05T02:39:50] **Howard**: is there a way that I give a "String" in default and put it as a Cell data type?

Now I only put it as   
self.individual_content = emptyCell();  [#1021](https://t.me/tactlang/1021)
[2023-01-05T02:20:31] **Steve Korshakov**: Ton-nodejs is deprecated  [#1020](https://t.me/tactlang/1020)
[2023-01-05T02:20:24] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes  [#1019](https://t.me/tactlang/1019)
[2023-01-04T22:17:21] **Howard**: Sorry, I am not familiar with TS libraries. Are these correct?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1017](https://t.me/tactlang/1017)) [#1018](https://t.me/tactlang/1018)
[2023-01-04T22:09:47] **Steve Korshakov**: Isn‚Äôt I told you to use new libraries several times?  [#1017](https://t.me/tactlang/1017)
[2023-01-04T18:59:41] **Howard**: Still will got error once using the .asSlice when I set a StringBuilder with a coming Cell datatype üòÖ  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [968](https://t.me/tactlang/968)) [#1015](https://t.me/tactlang/1015)
[2023-01-04T18:49:46] **Howard**: how we generated this events codeüòÖ  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [950](https://t.me/tactlang/950)) [#1014](https://t.me/tactlang/1014)
[2023-01-04T18:44:05] **Howard**: would be happy to see other people share how to fetch the data onchain on Tact template repo!

I will prepare with test file to test my contract first.  [#1013](https://t.me/tactlang/1013)
[2023-01-04T18:42:43] **Howard**: was easy like this to get smartContract data, but I think we changed the way to call the get function?  [#1012](https://t.me/tactlang/1012)
[2023-01-04T18:30:02] **Howard**: not the TS expert, but since we changed the compiled file structure. How can I access get method now like this for NFT collection?  [#1011](https://t.me/tactlang/1011)
[2023-01-04T18:22:59] **Howard**: how to access contract's get method right now>? Used to be accessing import { createExecutorFromRemote } from "ton-nodejs"; like here on TonBet https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.read.ts#L42  [#1010](https://t.me/tactlang/1010)
[2023-01-04T18:14:36] **Howard**: the old method shows the error now.ü•∂ü•≤  [#1009](https://t.me/tactlang/1009)
[2023-01-04T18:11:54] **Howard**: we changed the Read contract structure as well?  [#1008](https://t.me/tactlang/1008)
[2023-01-04T17:13:37] **Dario**: You should nt use hardencoded values  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1005](https://t.me/tactlang/1005)) [#1007](https://t.me/tactlang/1007)
[2023-01-04T17:12:27] **Howard**: Thanks for reply, will try right now.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1003](https://t.me/tactlang/1003)) [#1006](https://t.me/tactlang/1006)
[2023-01-04T17:12:18] **Howard**: I tried to type ton("0.1") but seems it will forward the all TON to next contract.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1003](https://t.me/tactlang/1003)) [#1005](https://t.me/tactlang/1005)
[2023-01-04T17:07:42] **Dario**: In tact,.idk how to do it. IMO there might be a static parser of the code that assume all conditions to true and estimate gas usage at the most, so we can use gas_usage everywhere and get pretty accurate estimations  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [1003](https://t.me/tactlang/1003)) [#1004](https://t.me/tactlang/1004)
[2023-01-04T17:04:41] **Dario**: To send two messages that is likely to forward unused gas, do something like this:

int gas = (msg_value - (storage_fee + GAS_USAGE+(fwd_gas_estimated * 2)) / 2;
And mode 0 on both messages.

you can use an hardencoded value for gasusage OR compute it dynamically based on gas price  [#1003](https://t.me/tactlang/1003)
[2023-01-04T17:03:20] **Howard**: any example with SendPayGasSeparately guys?  [#1002](https://t.me/tactlang/1002)
[2023-01-04T17:00:56] **Howard**: yeh, I think I need some example to learn how people deal with Txs in paralleled. Especially accessing different receive method. üò¢ The Tx all at failed with Auction Failed.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [984](https://t.me/tactlang/984)) [#1000](https://t.me/tactlang/1000)
[2023-01-04T16:58:57] **Howard**: /report  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [997](https://t.me/tactlang/997)) [#999](https://t.me/tactlang/999)
[2023-01-04T16:33:25] **Daniil Sedov**: /report  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [997](https://t.me/tactlang/997)) [#998](https://t.me/tactlang/998)
[2023-01-04T13:14:35] **Daniil Sedov**: Int to a cell -> just make the cell with a single (u)int256 or whatever size do you need  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [993](https://t.me/tactlang/993)) [#995](https://t.me/tactlang/995)
[2023-01-04T13:12:04] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes we are using this scheme usually since it is much more predictable and also saves on gas fees  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [992](https://t.me/tactlang/992)) [#994](https://t.me/tactlang/994)
[2023-01-04T13:11:14] **Howard**: I am thinking the custom_payload in practice. It's a Cell. 

Is there best way to transition the Int to a Cell`?  [#993](https://t.me/tactlang/993)
[2023-01-04T13:10:24] **Howard**: yeh, maybe I can set a receive method for owner to withdraw all the funds there  [#992](https://t.me/tactlang/992)
[2023-01-04T13:02:10] **Steve Korshakov**: Currently it is impossible to spend more than one ton in gas fees so this is your higher limit, you can always return remaining tons  [#991](https://t.me/tactlang/991)
[2023-01-04T13:00:12] **Steve Korshakov**: For jettons the issue that someone could keep them for years  [#990](https://t.me/tactlang/990)
[2023-01-04T12:59:32] **Steve Korshakov**: Kind of, but I am not using really this in non Jetton contracts, if you need your contract without money for less than say 6 months it is ok not to keep storage  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [985](https://t.me/tactlang/985)) [#989](https://t.me/tactlang/989)
[2023-01-04T12:58:34] **Steve Korshakov**: That‚Äôs the question of the year, but in general you manually estimate how you need in each case. Fees are fixed in ton or they would go down, not higher.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [972](https://t.me/tactlang/972)) [#988](https://t.me/tactlang/988)
[2023-01-04T12:05:27] **Howard**: ok ok  [#987](https://t.me/tactlang/987)
[2023-01-04T12:01:28] **Daniil Sedov**: Yes, you should keep some little amount on balance  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [985](https://t.me/tactlang/985)) [#986](https://t.me/tactlang/986)
[2023-01-04T11:50:24] **Howard**: then the next common issued is that, how we set for min_balance for a contract to maintain its functionality usually? In Steve's Jetton implementation, he keep 0.1 TON for a wallet contract tho.  [#985](https://t.me/tactlang/985)
[2023-01-04T11:47:08] **Daniil Sedov**: And if you really want to send "all remaining balance", you can try subtracting the fee from contract's balance manually and send the remaining  [#984](https://t.me/tactlang/984)
[2023-01-04T11:45:54] **Daniil Sedov**: If contracts 2 and 3 don't require you to attach some additional value to a msg, you can just send some little constant amount to cover the fees  [#983](https://t.me/tactlang/983)
[2023-01-04T11:44:59] **Daniil Sedov**: It all depends on what logic do you need to implement  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [981](https://t.me/tactlang/981)) [#982](https://t.me/tactlang/982)
[2023-01-04T11:43:17] **Howard**: then how you set value in each internal Txs?  [#981](https://t.me/tactlang/981)
[2023-01-04T11:42:46] **Daniil Sedov**: And if you use that mode in first outgoing msg, the second one won't have anything to send  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [977](https://t.me/tactlang/977)) [#980](https://t.me/tactlang/980)
[2023-01-04T11:42:26] **Daniil Sedov**: That "sendremainingvalue" mode doesn't take in account other outgoing messages  [#979](https://t.me/tactlang/979)
[2023-01-04T11:41:54] **Daniil Sedov**: probably that's the reason
I had a similar problem few days ago  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [977](https://t.me/tactlang/977)) [#978](https://t.me/tactlang/978)
[2023-01-04T11:41:41] **Howard**: I thought it failed because I use SendRemainingValue in first Send functions, I guess.  [#977](https://t.me/tactlang/977)
[2023-01-04T11:40:40] **Daniil Sedov**: Sum of both calls' values must be less than balance  [#975](https://t.me/tactlang/975)
[2023-01-04T11:39:10] **Daniil Sedov**: Maybe you're trying to send more than your contract's balance?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [972](https://t.me/tactlang/972)) [#974](https://t.me/tactlang/974)
[2023-01-04T11:37:54] **Howard**: Question about multi-calls in Contract:

I have the contract logic that will trigge like this. I am thinking that how I can set in 'value' field, to make sure the Tx will not failed? (Or any Mode I should set in Send function with parameters)

Because when I tried this at this moment, my contract will get Auction Failed.  [#972](https://t.me/tactlang/972)
[2023-01-04T10:57:46] **Steve Korshakov**: check 0.7.1, should show a correct error  [#971](https://t.me/tactlang/971)
[2023-01-04T10:47:05] **Steve Korshakov**: No type checking for declaration hm  [#970](https://t.me/tactlang/970)
[2023-01-04T10:46:56] **Steve Korshakov**: Ah I see  [#969](https://t.me/tactlang/969)
[2023-01-04T10:46:47] **Steve Korshakov**: asSlice?  [#968](https://t.me/tactlang/968)
[2023-01-04T10:46:43] **Steve Korshakov**: What do you mean?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [966](https://t.me/tactlang/966)) [#967](https://t.me/tactlang/967)
[2023-01-04T10:37:53] **Howard**: ok, founded, it's related to the .toSlice() method  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [964](https://t.me/tactlang/964)) [#966](https://t.me/tactlang/966)
[2023-01-04T10:31:35] **Steve Korshakov**: I will take a look  [#965](https://t.me/tactlang/965)
[2023-01-04T10:27:10] **Howard**: https://gist.github.com/howardpen9/713e22366604cace12f7c13a1ff18abf  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [963](https://t.me/tactlang/963)) [#964](https://t.me/tactlang/964)
[2023-01-04T10:24:46] **Steve Korshakov**: Please post the code to GitHub  [#963](https://t.me/tactlang/963)
[2023-01-04T10:24:19] **Howard**: ok. I removed the syntax for abi.pack_cell and got this error when compile. (Using ^0.7.0 already  [#961](https://t.me/tactlang/961)
[2023-01-04T10:15:21] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes  [#960](https://t.me/tactlang/960)
[2023-01-04T10:15:07] **Howard**: oh abi.pack_cell was removed ü§£  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [949](https://t.me/tactlang/949)) [#959](https://t.me/tactlang/959)
[2023-01-04T07:01:57] **Steve Korshakov**: Just relased a version that is incompatible with previous, it changes the way get methods expect arguments and return values. Also abi.pack_slice and abi.pack_cell was removed, new random functions

https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.7.0  [#958](https://t.me/tactlang/958)
[2023-01-03T22:51:15] **Steve Korshakov**: Ah yes, i need a simple centralized helper service to upload bindings during deploy  [#957](https://t.me/tactlang/957)
[2023-01-03T22:50:48] **Steve Korshakov**: Ofc solving bugs is important, but it wouldn't introduce breaking changes  [#956](https://t.me/tactlang/956)
[2023-01-03T22:49:53] **Steve Korshakov**: In general, i think we are 60% into production ready release. The things that stops from 1.0.0:
1) ABI interface and bindings. They are not stable right now and i am planning to change some logic in the nearest future
2) Dictionaries, i have implemented them in correct way in core libraries, but haven't ported everything to TACT
3) Improve random function. I think compiler must enforce randomize_lt before calling any random function, this is a serious breaking change that could alter behaviour.
4) Remove abi.pack_slice / abi.pack_cell and introduce .toCell in structures itself

Nothing else seems to be breaking changes  [#955](https://t.me/tactlang/955)
[2023-01-03T22:43:58] **Steve Korshakov**: üåö  [#954](https://t.me/tactlang/954)
[2023-01-03T22:43:52] **Steve Korshakov**: Sorry i was really busy solving all this legacy stuff in ton.js library and whole ecosystem  [#953](https://t.me/tactlang/953)
[2023-01-03T22:43:14] **Steve Korshakov**: Also, i am really looking into a list of a bugs, but i need them ready to test, usually just ready to build source helps  [#952](https://t.me/tactlang/952)
[2023-01-03T22:39:18] **Steve Korshakov**: BTW bindings now can work with v2 and v4 API as well as emulator using the same syntax!  [#951](https://t.me/tactlang/951)
[2023-01-03T22:34:44] **Steve Korshakov**: I need a feedback of testing: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template/blob/main/sources/contract.spec.ts

With a new api you are not testing contract as is, but in the whole system and things became a little bit different and little bit more complicated, but i hope it is still straightforward  [#950](https://t.me/tactlang/950)
[2023-01-03T22:32:30] **Steve Korshakov**: I just released TACT 0.6.0, no language changes, but it works with a new ton.js libraries and uses completely different way to test your contracts using new ton-emulator:

I recommend to checkout new template and copy your sources: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template  [#949](https://t.me/tactlang/949)
[2023-01-03T20:41:31] **None**: Good  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [947](https://t.me/tactlang/947)) [#948](https://t.me/tactlang/948)
[2023-01-03T18:32:41] **Howard**: OK, fix when I deleted the resolution changed in package.json  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [944](https://t.me/tactlang/944)) [#947](https://t.me/tactlang/947)
[2023-01-03T18:05:32] **Howard**: since compile completed, got this kind of error that I can't find the solution myself. 

 Property '#private' in type 'BitString' refers to a different member that cannot be accessed from within type 'BitString'

BitString? I didn't interactive with String tho.  [#944](https://t.me/tactlang/944)
[2023-01-03T17:16:05] **Alex Golev**: @steve_kite  I noticed fromInit() function in tests, and I can't launch successfully yarn test in jetton project. Is it something in progress? Or could You provide, what I should double check to achieve a successful launch of these tests?  [#943](https://t.me/tactlang/943)
[2023-01-03T13:34:38] **Howard**: Sorry, which one is incorrect?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [936](https://t.me/tactlang/936)) [#942](https://t.me/tactlang/942)

[2023-01-02T15:04:11] **Howard**: My question is: If I want to implement more functionality, should we let the user(pass on message format with 'query_id'). 

Or we just set a random query_id in smart contract code level?

[2023-01-02T08:04:13] **Howard**: It is failed. 

I checked with src/test/features/strings.tact in Tact repo, there is no direct way to put Cell to String. 

(aka, for NFT content, will need concat 2 string which store in Cell type in Smart Contract)

Any suggestion?  [#910](https://t.me/tactlang/910)

Let's take the example cases here again, in testnet-nft tool website we got the content for this collection for each:

Then I will store these URL separately in content? Got it.  [#903](https://t.me/tactlang/903)
[2023-01-01T17:33:59] **Seitaro Higuchi**: No, collection and each NFT of collection have it's own independent content.
However content of the NFT is not stored in it's contract but distributed between NFT and Collection. To get finalised NFT content you need to get individual_content from NFT contract and process it via collection's get_nft_content method. Such separation allows to build flexible systems, for instance
- collection can contain shared part of content of all items
- update of collection contract allows to update all NFT's content simultaneously by updating get_nft_content function (otherwise it would be necessary to update each NFT separately)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [901](https://t.me/tactlang/901)) [#902](https://t.me/tactlang/902)

[2023-01-01T16:58:01] **Alex Golev**: Well, I'm not sure what way will better for you. Perhaps @truecarry or @dvlkv could advice the best way. I looked through examples and It seems most relevant of them. You can check examples for NFT-deployers here.

[2023-01-01T16:05:19] **Howard**: I also tried this way, because you know, in NFT standard we need passed the Royalties Parameters and the URL.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [893](https://t.me/tactlang/893)) [#894](https://t.me/tactlang/894)
[2023-01-01T16:03:28] **Alex Golev**: Hey, hny. As I saw from source(also added short description here), it should work in this way:
StringBuilder s = beginString();
s.append("String");
Cell data = s.toCell();

or  in short form, perhaps
Cell data = beginString().append("String").toCell();

But need to check how Tact compiler(also, I'm not sure about boundaries for String length). As you really f&f I think you can try it right now. :)  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [891](https://t.me/tactlang/891)) [#893](https://t.me/tactlang/893)

[2023-01-01T15:50:57] **Howard**: hi, how to put "String" into Cell data type in Tact libraries? I am checking with getgems NFT libraries. 

I think what we need in Tact ecosystem is different. For example, when we deploy the contract with the initial content, we don't have "String" data type to put for NFT content(aka, the URL, the metadata, the string).

We only accept with Cell data type.  [#891](https://t.me/tactlang/891)
[2022-12-31T22:35:29] **Howard**: I followed most of the steps as reference in @steve_kite 's Jetton code. Because of those template that I can easily learn how to code in Tact!  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [889](https://t.me/tactlang/889)) [#890](https://t.me/tactlang/890)

But now the issued is that even I passed the Txs with right method code. The testnet.getgems.io still can't fetch my NFT data success. 

(aka, the get method for 'get_nft_data') 

1/ I can called and get my nft contract data back successfully. 

2/ Some people asked that I should change the Get Function name to exactly same in get_nft_data. But I don't think it would work.  [#881](https://t.me/tactlang/881)

[2022-12-31T06:05:32] **Howard**: Then I think I found a place might not followed TEP74-Jetton, correct me if I am wrong: 
the Jetton standard in this line under the fun mint(), it trigged the initial TransferInternal for the first Tx. 

The forward_amount should not put as zero as TEP said.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [873](https://t.me/tactlang/873)) [#877](https://t.me/tactlang/877)
[2022-12-31T05:57:16] **Steve Korshakov**: no, by default tx fees are paid from value of incoming messages  [#876](https://t.me/tactlang/876)
[2022-12-31T05:56:41] **Howard**: That is more like Account Abstraction I guess in EVM?

Then next question is, when the ton balance of JettonWallet Contract(let's say) going to zero, we need to transfer the TON to contract to maintain it can receive the Tx and execute the code as well?  [#875](https://t.me/tactlang/875)
[2022-12-31T05:54:06] **Steve Korshakov**: you usually need some ton in the message to make receiving part to execute code (this is how it paid for transactions)  [#874](https://t.me/tactlang/874)
[2022-12-31T05:53:44] **Steve Korshakov**: forward_ton_amount is the amount to attach to a message of a sent token  [#873](https://t.me/tactlang/873)
[2022-12-31T05:52:11] **Howard**: I am confusing with forward_ton_amount and fwd_fee I guess. 

To be clear, fwd_fee is the fee that we paid during the execution. 

And forward_ton_amount or forward_amount in TEP62 is the nano-ton that we move to token contract itself to paid with the future storage cost, is that correct?  [#872](https://t.me/tactlang/872)
[2022-12-31T05:50:13] **Howard**: This line of code is followed TEP64 here, right?  [#870](https://t.me/tactlang/870)

[2022-12-31T05:28:43] **Howard**: Hi, guys. I am test it out with Forward Fee, and it always failed because the ctx.value(aka the TON I sent) is lower than the value I got.

[2022-12-28T19:18:43] **Alex Golev**: It seems math.tact permanently included and you can use one of (randomize_lt(), randomize()), don't you?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [825](https://t.me/tactlang/825)) [#826](https://t.me/tactlang/826)
[2022-12-28T18:59:37] **Howard**: ok, would like to know how I can pick up a "random number" in Tact to set as query_id like we had in standards  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [808](https://t.me/tactlang/808)) [#825](https://t.me/tactlang/825)

[2022-12-28T17:35:01] **Howard**: There is also has input for get Method in NFT, what is the individual_nft_content means?  [#822](https://t.me/tactlang/822)
[2022-12-28T17:34:36] **Steve Korshakov**: You can‚Äôt parse manually in TACT this code is generated and value of op is a part of message definition  [#821](https://t.me/tactlang/821)
[2022-12-28T17:33:27] **Howard**: okok!  [#820](https://t.me/tactlang/820)
[2022-12-28T17:25:51] **Lev Chizhov**: There's just a function defined somewhere called op::get_royalty_params() that returns an int with the op-code of the operation, no special syntax involved  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [816](https://t.me/tactlang/816)) [#819](https://t.me/tactlang/819)
[2022-12-28T17:07:03] **Howard**: I think TACT haven't have the global syntax for this yet?  [#818](https://t.me/tactlang/818)
[2022-12-28T17:06:44] **Howard**: this method is "External message" right?  [#817](https://t.me/tactlang/817)
[2022-12-28T17:06:32] **Howard**: hi all, what is the op == op::get_royalty_params()? 

Which means the type of message send to smart Contract with method called get_royalty_params?  [#816](https://t.me/tactlang/816)
[2022-12-28T14:11:15] **Howard**: what is the recv_internal means in Tact? 

Like init() {}, right?  [#815](https://t.me/tactlang/815)
[2022-12-28T13:44:38] **Howard**: ok, builders never stop. Will try out implement a NFT version in Tact.  [#814](https://t.me/tactlang/814)
[2022-12-28T12:34:15] **Howard**: Would like to see what is the example in Tact for rollback action  [#813](https://t.me/tactlang/813)
[2022-12-28T12:31:33] **Howard**: Tagging the users using the contract status, is that ok in Tact? 

(For example, once the receive(Register) complete, then add 1 in self.counter)  [#812](https://t.me/tactlang/812)
[2022-12-28T12:30:39] **Howard**: On the other hand, I am building a DApp using self.counter: Int as the MemberID to tag for the users. 

One question is that, is this might be something issued happend there?  [#811](https://t.me/tactlang/811)
[2022-12-28T12:23:37] **Howard**: but will try out build a trait  [#810](https://t.me/tactlang/810)

[2022-12-28T11:10:46] **Howard**: Like, I can create a bounty by deposit some TONs, and since no one submit the Tx, then the funds will back to myself after 24 hours.  [#805](https://t.me/tactlang/805)
[2022-12-28T11:09:36] **Howard**: is there any functions that can count in BlockNumbers or Local Time? (Like 1 hour, 1 day...so on)

For example, would like to set a functions that will fallback the funds to original senders since after 24hrs.  [#804](https://t.me/tactlang/804)
[2022-12-28T09:35:09] **Howard**: OK, same mistake. 

If you get Exit Code 7 all the time since your ContractA will initialized a ContractB. It might be happend because you didn't set a default value for the dataType you claimed firstly!!

For example, the Tx will trigged a receive method in my contract that will generate a new contract.

But during the excecution, it's hard to get the rest of value that "after the gas used". Is there any any way to get so?  [#796](https://t.me/tactlang/796)

[2022-12-27T21:12:55] **doni**: I think it would be very interesting for you to study the jetton and nft architecture and understand how to shard data between multiple contracts

mapping / dictionaries have many cons due to the memory layout of ton ( everything is a bag of cells )  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [790](https://t.me/tactlang/790)) [#792](https://t.me/tactlang/792)

[2022-12-27T18:52:50] **Howard**: Tips: you can only set 8 mapping in one contract!!

Remember this then can save you lots of time!

Solution: Clean up the data structure, or create a new contract to store the data I guess.  [#790](https://t.me/tactlang/790)
[2022-12-27T18:47:07] **Howard**: noticed that an error will happen if I create to many mapping initially....  [#789](https://t.me/tactlang/789)

[2022-12-27T14:56:40] **Howard**: Oh! I got the solutions, maybe the space of Slice is different every time!

The best situation is record the size of Slice for this input String!

Aka, check the size of the Builder(the size of the Slice we got from Input)  [#773](https://t.me/tactlang/773)
[2022-12-27T14:38:17] **Howard**: make sense. Then how I should prepare for the bytes space if the input is the Numbers with "String type".

[2022-12-27T12:26:18] **Howard**: can't find .loadCoins() in https://github.com/ton-community/tact by the way. 

What is that means in detail?  [#757](https://t.me/tactlang/757)
[2022-12-27T11:50:22] **Steve Korshakov**: no, you have to parse numbers  [#755](https://t.me/tactlang/755)

Is .asSlice method already integrate in Tact @^0.5.0?  [#750](https://t.me/tactlang/750)
[2022-12-27T11:13:32] **Howard**: Slices? Can you share a gist for example?  [#749](https://t.me/tactlang/749)
[2022-12-27T11:13:16] **Steve Korshakov**: like receive a String, make it ".asSlice" and then read it byte by byte  [#748](https://t.me/tactlang/748)
[2022-12-27T11:12:55] **Steve Korshakov**: You can try to parse slices  [#747](https://t.me/tactlang/747)
[2022-12-27T11:11:25] **Howard**: Then that would be super super cool and easily get mass adoption.  [#746](https://t.me/tactlang/746)
[2022-12-27T11:11:10] **Howard**: yeh, understood. But I am thinking how I can integrate with @cryptoBot based on the comment feature when sending Tx. I want People can trigge Tx without wrapping the message.  [#745](https://t.me/tactlang/745)
[2022-12-27T11:10:28] **Steve Korshakov**: only by wrapping into a message  [#744](https://t.me/tactlang/744)
[2022-12-27T11:10:05] **Howard**: for the receive() method, is it able to receive Integer as a input?


I am thinking that how I can set series of functions once user send numbers, like '1, 2, 3, 4.....`

If receive integer number 1, I store his address.
if else receive the integer number 2, I store his TON balance..during the moment.  [#743](https://t.me/tactlang/743)

[2022-12-27T09:36:24] **Steve Korshakov**: Missing type check?  [#740](https://t.me/tactlang/740)
[2022-12-27T09:35:39] **Howard**: Tips: Noticed that you were not putting the same address in the mapping multiple time!

Although you can still compile the code to get the deploy URL and then send the transaction, you will not be able to activate this contract if you write it like this in the mapping! (For example, the mapData2 in the screenshot.)  [#738](https://t.me/tactlang/738)
[2022-12-27T07:39:53] **Howard**: Nice nice!!!!  [#737](https://t.me/tactlang/737)

[2022-12-27T05:55:20] **Steve Korshakov**: No, it is much more complicated that this. Better to take a look at whitepapers first  [#724](https://t.me/tactlang/724)
[2022-12-27T05:50:49] **Howard**: in Jetton Wallet standard:
We have     let fwdFee: Int = ctx.readForwardFee();  

What is .readForwardFee means? This is the "Gas Fee" of the Tx sent to the current contract, I guess?  [#723](https://t.me/tactlang/723)
[2022-12-26T20:40:57] **Howard**: I put it as Rust lang. Let's all.  [#722](https://t.me/tactlang/722)

[2022-12-26T18:50:32] **Howard**: Same issue: If you deploy a contract that can trigger the deployment of a new contract, you need to ensure that the initial parameters you specify have default values. In Rust, you must provide a default value for any Int or Address you set previously.

This is why we got Exit Code: 7  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [718](https://t.me/tactlang/718)) [#720](https://t.me/tactlang/720)
[2022-12-26T17:55:16] **Howard**: But in ton-bet example, we are using 3 parameters?  [#719](https://t.me/tactlang/719)
[2022-12-26T13:52:25] **Howard**: or maybe I should using fun xyz() that manipulate the value in the function.  [#717](https://t.me/tactlang/717)
[2022-12-26T13:51:41] **Howard**: Like here, return the Value A.

[2022-12-25T20:32:38] **Howard**: it shouldn't be the Contract Code error right? Or the abi issued.

(–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [706](https://t.me/tactlang/706)) [#709](https://t.me/tactlang/709)
[2022-12-25T20:23:13] **Alex Golev**: Hello, guys! I want to get into the creating of detailed documentation of the TACT language. This first footstep describes my vision of this work, based on what you mentioned earlier.
I ask involved people to consider the proposed plan and add comments if you have any thoughts how to improve it.  [#707](https://t.me/tactlang/707)
[2022-12-25T20:09:42] **Howard**: Out of my knowledge, definitely need Steve to trouble shooting ü•∂üòì the exitCode seems not the same means in _errors area in your ts file after you compile the contract code.  [#705](https://t.me/tactlang/705)
[2022-12-25T19:44:50] **Howard**: I wrote a 250 lines of code in practice, and got this error once I want to deploy. 

(Yes, it can compile successfully. And the input argument is correct)  [#704](https://t.me/tactlang/704)
[2022-12-25T14:05:31] **Howard**: is there any way we can test contract with more caller accounts? 

I know we can write test case on contract.spec.ts file, but that is not enough for me to test my contract  [#703](https://t.me/tactlang/703)
[2022-12-25T08:42:58] **Howard**: Like the template here, once we deploy the contract, we will using the packAdd function from the folder.

[2022-12-25T08:41:31] **Howard**: maybe we need an unpack script as well in output folder once we run yarn build successfully?  [#701](https://t.me/tactlang/701)
[2022-12-25T08:38:17] **Howard**: anyone know that?  [#699](https://t.me/tactlang/699)
[2022-12-25T06:47:19] **Howard**: How do I find my SmartContract TL-B schema to help me decoded the data I fetched from my on-chain data?  [#698](https://t.me/tactlang/698)
[2022-12-25T06:46:40] **Howard**: It's in BOC, you need to know the TL-B schema of the data. Then you can use any Slice implementation to read the data according to the schema.  [#697](https://t.me/tactlang/697)
[2022-12-24T13:57:10] **Howard**: I just declared a mapping with a struct in my code, and set the data into it! 

All the transactions ran successfully when I wrote the data into the chain.

But when I read the contract message, I got this kind of data set. As you can see, it should be based on a key input that is an Int. I get null when I input a key that is not an Int.

So when I printed all the mapping data, I got this. 

My question is, how can we read the mapping data from the smart contract successfully? Because I need to transform/decode the bits into an Int or?  [#693](https://t.me/tactlang/693)
[2022-12-24T13:07:27] **Howard**: Good to know:
1/ Can't use Builder or Slice data type on Tact.
2/ You can claim dataType with question mark that enable the data could be null. For example, if you claim one of data set in Struct with "Int?" then it could be Int or the Null.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [691](https://t.me/tactlang/691)) [#692](https://t.me/tactlang/692)
[2022-12-24T13:05:59] **Howard**: what is the Cell data type looks like in TVM on Tact? Haven't have any idea that how to input the message into it.  [#691](https://t.me/tactlang/691)
[2022-12-24T08:56:50] **Howard**: Fixed. Do not use ton@12.2.8 üòÇ  [#690](https://t.me/tactlang/690)
[2022-12-24T08:42:16] **Howard**: ummm even back to ton-tact@0.3.0 still got this error. So it's not the .tact file issued.  [#688](https://t.me/tactlang/688)
[2022-12-24T05:38:30] **Howard**: got error when compile, I already update to v0.5.0 then.

[2022-12-23T22:52:59] **doni**: what is paractice for sperators ? 

Action!arg1,arg2,  etc ?  [#684](https://t.me/tactlang/684)
[2022-12-23T22:52:58] **Steve Korshakov**: i am thinking about how to send schema to ledger but i am not able to figure out the best way to do so  [#683](https://t.me/tactlang/683)
[2022-12-23T22:52:36] **Steve Korshakov**: ah i got what you mean, yes text is better  [#682](https://t.me/tactlang/682)
[2022-12-23T22:51:37] **doni**: great expierence  [#681](https://t.me/tactlang/681)

[2022-12-23T22:51:18] **Steve Korshakov**: i send all transactions with text comments and confirm messages on the screen  [#679](https://t.me/tactlang/679)
[2022-12-23T22:51:00] **Steve Korshakov**: ofc it has it  [#678](https://t.me/tactlang/678)
[2022-12-23T22:50:56] **Steve Korshakov**: what do you mean?  [#677](https://t.me/tactlang/677)
[2022-12-23T22:50:23] **doni**: instead of HEX  [#676](https://t.me/tactlang/676)
[2022-12-23T22:50:20] **doni**: ok that would be great to see comments on the ledeger screen  [#675](https://t.me/tactlang/675)
[2022-12-23T22:50:07] **Steve Korshakov**: I actually thinking about expanding text parsing capabilities, it would be better for ledger  [#674](https://t.me/tactlang/674)
[2022-12-23T22:49:42] **Steve Korshakov**: also text could be confirmed on ledger  [#673](https://t.me/tactlang/673)
[2022-12-23T22:49:33] **Steve Korshakov**: one requires some code, another could be used with any wallet right out of the box  [#672](https://t.me/tactlang/672)
[2022-12-23T22:49:18] **Steve Korshakov**: yes  [#671](https://t.me/tactlang/671)

[2022-12-23T22:48:27] **Steve Korshakov**: second is for text message  [#669](https://t.me/tactlang/669)
[2022-12-23T22:47:27] **doni**: one is binary for mint message 

and the 2nd ?  [#668](https://t.me/tactlang/668)
[2022-12-23T22:47:00] **Steve Korshakov**: it is a different messages  [#667](https://t.me/tactlang/667)
[2022-12-23T22:45:38] **doni**: ;; Text Receivers

[2022-12-23T22:44:22] **doni**: double op ( comment and Int)  [#664](https://t.me/tactlang/664)
[2022-12-23T22:43:55] **doni**: not sure why the double op for every action ‚Ä¶ I will understand eventually just started  [#663](https://t.me/tactlang/663)
[2022-12-23T22:43:29] **doni**: Im trying to understand everything thorugh the source code ‚Ä¶ Im getting there step by step  [#662](https://t.me/tactlang/662)
[2022-12-23T22:42:28] **Steve Korshakov**: but tact right now requires to have at least one field so if it doesn't have fields it won't work  [#661](https://t.me/tactlang/661)
[2022-12-23T22:42:00] **Steve Korshakov**: if you want i think you can do the same message with such opcode  [#660](https://t.me/tactlang/660)
[2022-12-23T22:41:49] **Steve Korshakov**: well, mint is not part so it is custom  [#659](https://t.me/tactlang/659)
[2022-12-23T22:41:29] **doni**: i will by pass that  [#658](https://t.me/tactlang/658)
[2022-12-23T22:41:23] **doni**: well mint doesnt work  [#657](https://t.me/tactlang/657)
[2022-12-23T22:41:18] **doni**: I will play with it  [#656](https://t.me/tactlang/656)
[2022-12-23T22:41:17] **Steve Korshakov**: did it work?  [#655](https://t.me/tactlang/655)
[2022-12-23T22:41:09] **doni**: I tried to test it with tests and tools that already exsits  [#654](https://t.me/tactlang/654)
[2022-12-23T22:40:43] **doni**: I agree =) not a crc of anything  [#653](https://t.me/tactlang/653)
[2022-12-23T22:40:19] **Steve Korshakov**: idk, op = 21 is a weird choise  [#652](https://t.me/tactlang/652)
[2022-12-23T22:39:34] **doni**: I agree its not on TEP 74 , 
but its part of the source code https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/op-codes.fc  [#651](https://t.me/tactlang/651)
[2022-12-23T22:38:38] **Steve Korshakov**: mint is not part of the standard i think  [#650](https://t.me/tactlang/650)
[2022-12-23T22:38:18] **doni**: I have a question regarding the jetton impl. 

I see that its not the same interface ( opcodes are different bc of the hash256(‚Äúmint‚Äù) convention ) right ?  [#649](https://t.me/tactlang/649)
[2022-12-23T22:27:30] **Steve Korshakov**: One of the nicest things is that TACT now generates ids for errors and require method now accepts a string and put mappings into ABI.  [#648](https://t.me/tactlang/648)
[2022-12-23T22:25:37] **Steve Korshakov**: btw, subscribe to this channel, it always meant to be a independent source of all dev tools news. if you have something to post, please share with me, let's improve this group  [#647](https://t.me/tactlang/647)
[2022-12-23T22:23:47] **Steve Korshakov**: TACT Compiler release v0.5.0
- Constants
- Jettons example and library
- require now accepts string as second parameter
- Optional address is now serialized using native representation, not tact-one

[2022-12-23T20:09:46] **Howard**: OK, I checked this repo and try to navigate the use case of assign the data into Struct. Will learn more in TON whitepaper and see who can share the example for Struct in storage üòµ‚Äçüí´  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [607](https://t.me/tactlang/607)) [#645](https://t.me/tactlang/645)

[2022-12-23T16:39:36] **Howard**: How to implement the data into the struct I design in a map I have called myMap: map[Address]myStruct  [#640](https://t.me/tactlang/640)
[2022-12-23T15:29:56] **Howard**: is there any time limitation I can add in Tact, like timestamp + 3 days in solidity.  [#639](https://t.me/tactlang/639)
[2022-12-23T13:41:25] **Vitaly**: you have moved examples out of src as it seems  [#638](https://t.me/tactlang/638)

[2022-12-23T13:35:25] **Howard**: Oh, yes. It's null. I found answer here: 
https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/examples/increment.tact  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [634](https://t.me/tactlang/634)) [#635](https://t.me/tactlang/635)
[2022-12-23T13:23:38] **Howard**: What is the default Bool value in Tact. I got failed with ExitCode 7....change a bit but still can't find the solution.

I am thinking that for the require statement, it is not correct. Because the if the address never store in the mapping, it will get Null.  [#634](https://t.me/tactlang/634)
[2022-12-23T12:04:51] **Howard**: like in TypeScript library, we turn address to executor here. But how to reverse it back to 36bytes?  [#633](https://t.me/tactlang/633)
[2022-12-23T12:02:11] **Howard**: Hi, I am playing with mapping now on Tact. The structure I set is quite simple as pic1, and pic2 shows the mapping data I got when I read from contract.

Question: How can I turn the address data in the mapping, turn back to the readable address format?  [#631](https://t.me/tactlang/631)
[2022-12-23T09:24:19] **Howard**: Same as the syntax here I got from TonBet files:

1) Why we need nativeReserve to keep more spaces for storage? And where is this words coming from?

2) Why SimpleSend function (in below) need to keep extract plus 2 with 128? Also because of TVM design that we need keep the extract space for storage? 

üßê Please bear with the questions I asked here. I am just intensively learning tact.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [473](https://t.me/tactlang/473)) [#626](https://t.me/tactlang/626)
[2022-12-23T09:07:37] **Howard**: just trying to understand the new type StateInit, is it a data type that you import from library "@stdlib/ownable"? Can't find in any place on tact-template.

I know it's a method that when you want to create a new contract, you will need initialized the code for it. 

But where is this type word came from?  [#625](https://t.me/tactlang/625)
[2022-12-23T08:52:35] **Howard**: Try to compile but got this error, even tho I put these file in the same place.  [#624](https://t.me/tactlang/624)
[2022-12-23T08:51:57] **Howard**: is it possible to import directly by putting these .tact in the same place?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [615](https://t.me/tactlang/615)) [#622](https://t.me/tactlang/622)
[2022-12-23T07:52:12] **Howard**: Just deploy to test net then send tx each by each?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [615](https://t.me/tactlang/615)) [#621](https://t.me/tactlang/621)
[2022-12-22T18:54:57] **Seitaro Higuchi**: What a surprise!
There are toncli tests for jettons in toncli main repo and I believe there ton-contract-executor tests there as well. Should be a good start  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [616](https://t.me/tactlang/616)) [#617](https://t.me/tactlang/617)
[2022-12-22T18:35:31] **Steve Korshakov**: It turns if you rewrite jettons to TACT, standard would make sense  [#616](https://t.me/tactlang/616)
[2022-12-22T18:33:36] **Steve Korshakov**: Just finished Jetton implementation on TACT. Now create your own jetton contract very easy:
https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/src/examples/jetton.tact

stdlib implementation details:
https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/wallet.tact
https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/master.tact
https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/messages.tact

It would be useful if someone review this and check that this indeed works. Do we have tools to check jettons on testnet?  [#615](https://t.me/tactlang/615)

[2022-12-22T17:40:30] **Andrey Pfau**: I will definitely start picking the tact as soon as I finish my current tasks  [#613](https://t.me/tactlang/613)
[2022-12-22T17:38:22] **Steve Korshakov**: Thanks!  [#612](https://t.me/tactlang/612)
[2022-12-22T17:37:47] **Andrey Pfau**: I've been running my eyes quickly right now and the syntax is very cool, very kotlinish, just like I love it. Very good job, @steve_kite üòç  [#611](https://t.me/tactlang/611)
[2022-12-22T17:33:05] **Andrey Pfau**: although the syntax is very similar to BNF for Intellij, I will still make edits to it to interact with the internal API, so don't worry. This is exactly what I need  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [609](https://t.me/tactlang/609)) [#610](https://t.me/tactlang/610)
[2022-12-22T17:31:23] **Steve Korshakov**: I recommend not to use it as is since it is tailloared for compilation  [#609](https://t.me/tactlang/609)

[2022-12-22T17:30:38] **Andrey Pfau**: @steve_kite where i can see grammar for new tact? I wanna implement support to intellij after NY  [#606](https://t.me/tactlang/606)
[2022-12-22T17:30:33] **Steve Korshakov**: yes, all types have this encodings inside of generated bindings  [#605](https://t.me/tactlang/605)
[2022-12-22T17:29:21] **Howard**: just like here packAdd is the method which is executable from this smart contract.  [#604](https://t.me/tactlang/604)
[2022-12-22T17:28:05] **Howard**: I see. I can find the encode modules in the output folder that inside the xxxx.ts  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [601](https://t.me/tactlang/601)) [#603](https://t.me/tactlang/603)
[2022-12-22T17:23:42] **Steve Korshakov**: deploy in ton is the same as just sending a message  [#602](https://t.me/tactlang/602)
[2022-12-22T17:23:35] **Steve Korshakov**: no, this is have to be encoded to cell and send just like during deploy  [#601](https://t.me/tactlang/601)
[2022-12-22T17:22:16] **Howard**: ummm then how I pass string like this receive(msg: Join2) in comment area?

It's "Join2, my-address, 10" ?  [#600](https://t.me/tactlang/600)
[2022-12-22T17:04:09] **Steve Korshakov**: and tonkeeper would encode it by itself  [#599](https://t.me/tactlang/599)
[2022-12-22T17:03:48] **Steve Korshakov**: it encodes everything for you, just pass string  [#598](https://t.me/tactlang/598)
[2022-12-22T17:03:01] **Howard**: like this line of code in test, I just want to trigged the receive method and passed the ValueA / ValueB through TonKeeper. 

I have to encoded the input value in TypeScript first right?  [#597](https://t.me/tactlang/597)
[2022-12-22T16:59:15] **Howard**: How you guys put the input String(the text want to send to smartContract) coded to type Cell or any else?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [529](https://t.me/tactlang/529)) [#596](https://t.me/tactlang/596)
[2022-12-22T16:32:37] **Howard**: Understood. If I want to trigger the receive method with Name<>Address and Score<>Int as input, I need to encode these values as a code and combine them in the URL. 

This will allow TonKeeper to send the correct information to the contract. 

We cannot just put these informations in the comment area directly if we want to transfer the funds to other address let's say.  [#595](https://t.me/tactlang/595)
[2022-12-22T15:23:37] **Howard**: But there is no error since I just remove the import for 'readString' and 'StringToCell'. All good now.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [589](https://t.me/tactlang/589)) [#594](https://t.me/tactlang/594)
[2022-12-22T15:22:52] **Howard**: Yes, I had. Because I am using the template.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [592](https://t.me/tactlang/592)) [#593](https://t.me/tactlang/593)
[2022-12-22T15:20:18] **Steve Korshakov**: i usually enforce to a single version by adding this to package.json

  "resolutions": {
    "ton": "12.3.2"
  },  [#592](https://t.me/tactlang/592)
[2022-12-22T15:18:56] **Howard**: The expected type comes from property 'initialData' which is declared here on type '{ workchain: number; initialCode: Cell; initialData: Cell; }'


Have you got this error on the origin deploy scripts?  [#591](https://t.me/tactlang/591)
[2022-12-22T15:12:39] **Steve Korshakov**: update it to the latest version too  [#590](https://t.me/tactlang/590)
[2022-12-22T15:11:34] **Howard**: If you got this error said Module '"ton"' has no exported member 'readString'.ts

Remember to run yarn add ton  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [588](https://t.me/tactlang/588)) [#589](https://t.me/tactlang/589)
[2022-12-22T13:57:50] **Steve Korshakov**: üöÄ Minor release 0.4.0

https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.4.0  [#588](https://t.me/tactlang/588)
[2022-12-22T13:49:25] **shahar**: so you get:
- a good (though not perfect) level of trust,
- pinning out of the box,
- upgrade path to ton storage
- some deduplication due to it relying on code cell hash instead of being per contract  [#587](https://t.me/tactlang/587)
[2022-12-22T13:48:22] **shahar**: it minimizes the probabilty of a source being fake. 
in the approach where the contract declares on the sources itself, there‚Äôs no other authority to verify that when publishing the ipfs link, which obviously can be forged.

so yes, the contracts can be re-verified, but would we want explorers displaying the source code and encouraging all users to re-verify all the time?

with verifiers, there‚Äôs a gatekeeper. that gatekeeper would need to be compromised in order to publish a fake proof.  [#586](https://t.me/tactlang/586)
[2022-12-22T13:45:15] **Steve Korshakov**: just simple web app that displays and verifies source on client  [#585](https://t.me/tactlang/585)
[2022-12-22T13:45:00] **Steve Korshakov**: actually i don't see the need for verifiers as it is since you can always recompile in browser itself  [#584](https://t.me/tactlang/584)
[2022-12-22T13:43:46] **shahar**: also the proof contracts are upgradeable, so that you won‚Äôt need to redeploy them when upgrading from ipfs to ton-storage  [#583](https://t.me/tactlang/583)
[2022-12-22T13:42:00] **Steve Korshakov**: Also it would be possible to perform re-verification in browser  [#582](https://t.me/tactlang/582)
[2022-12-22T13:41:57] **shahar**: the proof-contracts provide the ipfs link to the sources  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [579](https://t.me/tactlang/579)) [#581](https://t.me/tactlang/581)
[2022-12-22T13:41:30] **shahar**: yes, it allows different parties to register as verifiers that ensure that the provided source compiles to the same hash as onchain.  [#580](https://t.me/tactlang/580)
[2022-12-22T13:41:30] **Steve Korshakov**: i want to provide ipfs link to sources too, you would be able to scan contracts on the network and capture all sources and verify them automatically  [#579](https://t.me/tactlang/579)
[2022-12-22T13:40:49] **Steve Korshakov**: verify source?  [#578](https://t.me/tactlang/578)
[2022-12-22T13:40:45] **shahar**: the architecture is a bit different, where there‚Äôs a proof-contract for each code cell hash, and there‚Äôs a main sources registry that‚Äôs queried for the child contract addresses.  [#577](https://t.me/tactlang/577)
[2022-12-22T13:39:37] **shahar**: we have the https://tonverifier.live service that can handle that  [#576](https://t.me/tactlang/576)
[2022-12-22T13:39:37] **shahar**: definitely. I think that publishing the proof is a different step  [#575](https://t.me/tactlang/575)
[2022-12-22T13:39:21] **Steve Korshakov**: i personally want to have compiler completely offline i often work on planesüëÄ  [#574](https://t.me/tactlang/574)
[2022-12-22T13:38:51] **Steve Korshakov**: i will provide an opt-in (out?) service to upload abi  [#573](https://t.me/tactlang/573)
[2022-12-22T13:38:30] **Steve Korshakov**: yes  [#572](https://t.me/tactlang/572)
[2022-12-22T13:38:19] **shahar**: is it up to the contract owner to upload and pin the abi-ipfs artifact?  [#571](https://t.me/tactlang/571)
[2022-12-22T12:58:48] **Steve Korshakov**: You need to construct it via {‚Ä¶}  [#570](https://t.me/tactlang/570)
[2022-12-22T12:50:40] **Howard**: Seems I am struggling in using Struct in practice now  [#569](https://t.me/tactlang/569)
[2022-12-22T12:39:52] **Steve Korshakov**: Update the compiler  [#567](https://t.me/tactlang/567)
[2022-12-22T12:39:22] **Howard**: Got an error here when set the Struct  [#564](https://t.me/tactlang/564)
[2022-12-22T12:38:32] **Un gars bien**: would love to see them too üòµ still lost in FunC documentation on dicts  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [551](https://t.me/tactlang/551)) [#563](https://t.me/tactlang/563)
[2022-12-22T11:47:11] **Steve Korshakov**: Or tonbet stores bet value in BetHolder  [#560](https://t.me/tactlang/560)
[2022-12-22T11:46:58] **Steve Korshakov**: Just like multisig contract stores all pending transactions in separate contract  [#559](https://t.me/tactlang/559)
[2022-12-22T11:46:38] **Steve Korshakov**: Ton is scalable, you can store it yes but not in a single contract, but in many separate one  [#558](https://t.me/tactlang/558)
[2022-12-22T11:43:50] **Howard**: Oh, ok. Thanks! Would like to see more example codes from you! 
With the usage of mapping and customized struct.

Thinking how fast or convenient it is in TON blockchain. If I want to store the data on-chain in TON. Let's say a dataset for a school, is it ok to store those data on-chain?

You know, in EVM it's so expensive to store the data like this on-chain.  [#557](https://t.me/tactlang/557)
[2022-12-22T11:43:43] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes, they all also async  [#556](https://t.me/tactlang/556)
[2022-12-22T11:43:14] **Howard**: I will say the customized message in TON is super cool. 

More like I can specifically asked what Smart Contract should do. Compared with Solidity, this is more flexible to scale the usage of the functions, right?  [#555](https://t.me/tactlang/555)
[2022-12-22T11:43:10] **Steve Korshakov**: Yes I will generate error codes from error messages but explorer won‚Äôt show you the message, it is available only knowing abi and explorers doesn‚Äôt support it yet  [#554](https://t.me/tactlang/554)
[2022-12-22T11:40:20] **Howard**: OK, then that was bad because I can't find out why the transaction failed even though I test it before. Maybe can adding the comment message in require like:
require( valueA > valueB, "tx failed because valueB is bigger than valueA");  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [549](https://t.me/tactlang/549)) [#553](https://t.me/tactlang/553)
[2022-12-22T11:40:17] **Steve Korshakov**: Struct almost the same though  [#552](https://t.me/tactlang/552)
[2022-12-22T11:37:20] **Howard**: Would love to try out Struct and and mapping right now in tact  [#551](https://t.me/tactlang/551)
[2022-12-22T11:37:09] **Howard**: oh I think I understand how message works.  [#550](https://t.me/tactlang/550)
[2022-12-22T11:32:15] **Steve Korshakov**: There are no events in TON right now and they work different here  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [540](https://t.me/tactlang/540)) [#549](https://t.me/tactlang/549)
[2022-12-22T11:30:50] **Steve Korshakov**: 128 sends all remaining balance of a contract  [#548](https://t.me/tactlang/548)
[2022-12-22T11:30:37] **Steve Korshakov**: 64 sends all remaining value of an incoming message  [#547](https://t.me/tactlang/547)
[2022-12-22T11:29:35] **Howard**: What is the simpleReply means here in your TonBet contract?

https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.tact#L204


Can't properly find why 64 here, and use 128 in other place.  [#546](https://t.me/tactlang/546)
[2022-12-22T11:28:16] **Howard**: maybe I asked with a misleading way.  [#545](https://t.me/tactlang/545)
[2022-12-22T11:28:03] **Howard**: oh?  [#544](https://t.me/tactlang/544)
[2022-12-22T11:14:32] **Steve Korshakov**: I am working on error codes, description is in Abi currently  [#543](https://t.me/tactlang/543)
[2022-12-22T11:02:41] **Howard**: ummm, need to know how to set ERROR code. Otherwise it's hard to know why the tx fallback.

[2022-12-22T08:55:21] **Howard**: For example, I am trying to build a Vault contract which can store every deposit record. Like the code below:

Since the receive method can't put like this firstly? üòÖüòÖ


*I am thinking the way like 
emit UploadRecord(msg.sender, _amount, _code); 
in Solidity.  [#540](https://t.me/tactlang/540)
[2022-12-22T08:33:50] **Howard**: can you explain more on Context means in Tact? I can't find on document for this yet. 

And seems this is a default syntax that we can use? Like address(this) in Solidity?  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [473](https://t.me/tactlang/473)) [#539](https://t.me/tactlang/539)

[2022-12-22T06:21:31] **Howard**: I just deployed a contract on testnet! (It's so cool that I can deploy through TonKeeper, awesome experience!)

But I got this error that exit code 130 on explorer, is there any Explorer I can test the contract or interacting with it directly? https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/kQA54BekYjFpmVa4AMD6cB2Eu_GYD9KATiQgrxeMXmci_KPj  [#536](https://t.me/tactlang/536)
[2022-12-22T04:11:23] **Dan Volkov**: Great! Strings look like a game changer üòÖ  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [534](https://t.me/tactlang/534)) [#535](https://t.me/tactlang/535)

A lot of fixes and deep strings support!  [#534](https://t.me/tactlang/534)
[2022-12-21T22:09:15] **Steve Korshakov**: Added more docs about TACT: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/docs/overview.md  [#533](https://t.me/tactlang/533)

[2022-12-21T14:41:44] **Oleg Andreev**: no, the messages in Tact are the TON messages: things that contracts (actors) communicate with  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [524](https://t.me/tactlang/524)) [#526](https://t.me/tactlang/526)
[2022-12-21T14:10:20] **Howard**: is a way that help us can track on-chain data for the smart contract behavior  [#525](https://t.me/tactlang/525)
[2022-12-21T14:09:27] **Howard**: so the`message` in .tact is more like Event in solidity, right?  [#524](https://t.me/tactlang/524)
[2022-12-21T08:30:17] **doni**: is there a jetton implementation in tact yet ?  [#523](https://t.me/tactlang/523)

[2022-12-20T21:05:50] **Steve Korshakov**: Ton have multiple chains, you should use only 0 one  [#521](https://t.me/tactlang/521)
[2022-12-20T21:05:15] **Howard**: what is the test-net ID on workchain parameter?  [#520](https://t.me/tactlang/520)
[2022-12-20T19:59:00] **Steve Korshakov**: i think my template doesn't use base64 in url-safe mode  [#519](https://t.me/tactlang/519)

[2022-12-20T19:56:43] **Steve Korshakov**: There are no docs, though, only examples.  [#516](https://t.me/tactlang/516)
[2022-12-20T19:56:21] **Steve Korshakov**: It is working, but uses experimental standards that are not yet to be finalized. I would recommend to use it if you are not planning to launch something VERY big in a month.  [#515](https://t.me/tactlang/515)
[2022-12-20T19:55:22] **Vitaly**: Is there like a post or something to explain what's the current status of tact? 
I gather it's functional on some level but everything is a bit confusing  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [513](https://t.me/tactlang/513)) [#514](https://t.me/tactlang/514)
[2022-12-20T19:53:32] **Steve Korshakov**: HOPEFULLY ledger would be tomorrow  [#513](https://t.me/tactlang/513)
[2022-12-20T19:53:31] **Howard**: oh, understood  [#512](https://t.me/tactlang/512)
[2022-12-20T19:50:33] **Steve Korshakov**: it is done this way to be able to commit changes and always new what you are going to deploy  [#510](https://t.me/tactlang/510)
[2022-12-20T19:50:14] **Steve Korshakov**: so you need first to build it, yarn build, and then deploy  [#509](https://t.me/tactlang/509)
[2022-12-20T19:50:03] **Steve Korshakov**: deploy uses the one you built before  [#508](https://t.me/tactlang/508)
[2022-12-20T19:49:40] **Howard**: Because I thought at least it should be get error message if code is not completed. 

like Remix here.  [#507](https://t.me/tactlang/507)
[2022-12-20T19:41:54] **Steve Korshakov**: you can write tests to test everything  [#506](https://t.me/tactlang/506)
[2022-12-20T19:36:18] **Howard**: because yarn deploy didn't check any functional for the Tact code itself.  [#505](https://t.me/tactlang/505)
[2022-12-20T19:35:59] **Howard**: Correct we if I am wrong: You can still deploy the code even the smart contract having the bug, right?  [#504](https://t.me/tactlang/504)
[2022-12-20T19:30:26] **Steve Korshakov**: no  [#503](https://t.me/tactlang/503)
[2022-12-20T19:29:43] **kalloc**: ouch, don't you have vscode extension?  [#502](https://t.me/tactlang/502)
[2022-12-20T19:29:06] **kalloc**: i can port vscode syntax to tree-sitter  [#501](https://t.me/tactlang/501)

[2022-12-20T19:28:29] **kalloc**: or tree-sitter ?  [#498](https://t.me/tactlang/498)
[2022-12-20T19:28:23] **kalloc**: hm do you have vim syntax for tact ?  [#497](https://t.me/tactlang/497)
[2022-12-20T19:27:50] **Howard**: lmao I tried to changed it to ton:// seems still can't work properly. But your suggestion is good.  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [493](https://t.me/tactlang/493)) [#496](https://t.me/tactlang/496)
[2022-12-20T19:24:36] **Steve Korshakov**: I think eventually i will finalize tonblack.com and give a simple way to perform transactions via any available wallet  [#495](https://t.me/tactlang/495)
[2022-12-20T19:24:01] **Steve Korshakov**: Yeah, i usually copy it to mac notes app and sync it to an iphone and then click a link  [#493](https://t.me/tactlang/493)
[2022-12-20T19:19:27] **Howard**: then the problem will be: the browser can't read the URL long like this. I sent the testTON to through this URL, and it failled.  [#492](https://t.me/tactlang/492)
[2022-12-20T19:18:42] **Howard**: awesome @steve_kite, but I got issued when I get the initial deploy code like here  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [473](https://t.me/tactlang/473)) [#491](https://t.me/tactlang/491)
[2022-12-20T18:40:34] **Howard**: that is helpful  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [471](https://t.me/tactlang/471)) [#488](https://t.me/tactlang/488)
[2022-12-20T18:38:41] **Steve Korshakov**: like.. there are no concept of a stack at all in my code, rolling out this would be just reinventing func  [#487](https://t.me/tactlang/487)
[2022-12-20T18:37:08] **Steve Korshakov**: Yeah, stack-based optimizer is much much easier to do on func level since there are limited types and everything is much lower level. On high level it is unreasonable to do since there are too much magic involved  [#486](https://t.me/tactlang/486)
[2022-12-20T18:34:49] **Seitaro Higuchi**: I also want to emphasize that solidity is also compiles to intermediate human-readable language Yul. So it has some sense.  [#485](https://t.me/tactlang/485)
[2022-12-20T18:32:47] **Steve Korshakov**: compiler is quite straight forward  [#484](https://t.me/tactlang/484)
[2022-12-20T18:32:27] **shahar**: Would generated func be easy to read for complex contracts?  [#483](https://t.me/tactlang/483)
[2022-12-20T18:32:26] **Steve Korshakov**: and i would need to build my own func in practice  [#482](https://t.me/tactlang/482)
[2022-12-20T18:32:23] **doni**: fift is impossible  [#481](https://t.me/tactlang/481)
[2022-12-20T18:31:59] **Steve Korshakov**: Right now you can still review code that generated and check that everything is fine, fift is impossible to read  [#480](https://t.me/tactlang/480)
[2022-12-20T18:31:37] **Steve Korshakov**: too much risk  [#479](https://t.me/tactlang/479)
[2022-12-20T18:31:23] **shahar**: Why compile to func btw and not directly to fift?  [#478](https://t.me/tactlang/478)
[2022-12-20T18:12:06] **Steve Korshakov**: I think we urgently need to kill func as language for newcomers, it is very good low level one, but not much above.  [#477](https://t.me/tactlang/477)
[2022-12-20T18:10:55] **talkol**: We don't have anything against TACT, it's a good idea to improve the language, we just want to be involved :)  [#476](https://t.me/tactlang/476)
[2022-12-20T18:10:35] **Steve Korshakov**: and some quality of life improvements like constants, enums and may be unions, but it is not that interesting  [#475](https://t.me/tactlang/475)
[2022-12-20T18:10:16] **Steve Korshakov**: I just don't like this part: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.tact#L152

But unaware how to clearly without losing flexibility  [#474](https://t.me/tactlang/474)
[2022-12-20T18:08:39] **Steve Korshakov**: I spent only 30 minutes to build this contract: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/main/sources/contract.tact  [#473](https://t.me/tactlang/473)
[2022-12-20T18:08:05] **Steve Korshakov**: My initial impression of this new compiler was remarkable. I recently tested distributed betting contract. It was so easy to build comparing to nominator's pool that not even distributed. Ability to automatically extract ABI, build interfaces list, clean and a safe way to build contracts is remarkable comparing to func. 

I don't see the reason to even try to continue to push func tools for general audience since it is just awful (and reason why we don't have much apps in ton still), compiler have some issues, but they are on par with func level.  [#472](https://t.me/tactlang/472)
[2022-12-20T18:01:49] **Seitaro Higuchi**: This group was pretty dead for two or three months, until @steve_kite started his own Tact implementation  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [468](https://t.me/tactlang/468)) [#471](https://t.me/tactlang/471)

[2022-12-17T17:48:58] **Yakitori**: gm - Have been following TON for a while, I was a bit reluctant to commit completely due to FunC laborious syntax, so Tact is a great step forward!  [#450](https://t.me/tactlang/450)

[2022-12-16T13:20:58] **Kirill Malev**: It is very hard to write contracts for ton IF you are trying to use your experience from other blockchains. And it is quite easy once you got into distributed thinking  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [443](https://t.me/tactlang/443)) [#444](https://t.me/tactlang/444)

[2022-12-16T13:12:23] **Steve Korshakov**: More like "thinking in TON" since a lot of people coming with solidity in mind and tact intentionally doesn't have much in common  [#441](https://t.me/tactlang/441)
[2022-12-16T13:11:46] **Steve Korshakov**: This is a decent summary, it could be expanded to teach about TON concepts during deeper and deeper tutorials  [#440](https://t.me/tactlang/440)
[2022-12-16T13:09:11] **Roman Krutovoy**: Regarding the tact documentation, I see it like this:

‚Äî Installation (done)
‚Äî The most simple example of the language
‚Äî Building contract process
‚Äî Deploying contract process
‚Äî List of examples in the repository as text links

+ write materials in the "thinking in TON" paradigm:

It is very hard to write contracts for ton IF you are trying to use your experience from other blockchains. And it is quite easy once you got into distributed thinking

What is it should be in Tact or the Smart Contract on TVM. Like,

[2022-09-06T15:23:57] **Oleg Andreev**: But that would require extension beyond TVM for sign operations, ignoring gas and making sure we don‚Äôt deploy that code to a blockchain.

[2022-09-06T15:03:03] **Oleg Andreev**: We may also consider similarly offchain "action" methods that would map into SDK directly and perform client-side checks such as "read seqno from the contract state and use it in the message and sign".  [#289](https://t.me/tactlang/289)
[2022-09-06T15:01:47] **Oleg Andreev**: I think view/get methods are the ideal for UI integration because message formats are usually designed for compactness and you may need some "unpacking" to do in the get method to turn some bits into a readable number.

It's a good point. I risk looking a little foolish here. Is there any way we could have something like auto-generated abi later? 

So we could parse methods and run them using UI in an external software like an online IDE for newcomers using Tact (like RemixIDE analog).  (–û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ [285](https://t.me/tactlang/285)) [#287](https://t.me/tactlang/287)
[2022-09-06T00:44:41] **Oleg Andreev**: Hey everyone, a short status update on Tact.

Tact as an improved FunC

Today Tact is a working language that compiles to FunC and offers a number of features that help writing TON contracts with considerably less boilerplate. Big kudos to @cmxog and @p0lunin for pulling this off and getting us to that point.

Tact compiler supports some basic features: control flow and operators, and adds to FunC with nice definitions for structs and enums, automatic de/serialization to/from cells and offers a working model for generic types that lets implementing safe APIs such as checking signed message and extracting its body in one call.

You can check out how Wallet V3 code looks like in Tact right now: 
https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/examples/wallet_v3.tact

At this stage Tact still has some oddities and boilerplate that is easy to fix within the current model: e.g. adding mutable slices will let us cleanup annoying "trailing" slices, and we can bake in the serialization compatible with TL-B to remove unnecessary "derive impl (De)serialize" calls. But these are just small polishing tasks that we will put aside for a minute and look at the bigger picture.

The road ahead: from ‚ÄúRust‚Äù to ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù

Let's draw some parallels with popular systems programming languages: C, Rust and Swift. 

FunC is, well, "fun C" :-), a thin abstraction over underlying machine with a much nicer syntax than an assembly language. 

Current Tact is somewhat similar to Rust: it has a more expressive and safer type system, plus some syntactic affordances, yet delegating a lot of choices to the user and having some annoying internal details sticking out whether you need them or not.

What we want to achieve is a leap-frog language that focuses on the developer experience and makes writing most contracts significantly easier than FunC and the current Tact, thus making development on TON much more accessible to new enthusiasts who join the community today and in the future. 

At the risk of making a bad analogy, I will refer to Swift: this is a language that tries to combine two opposites ‚Äî being capable to express the finest details of the program with minimal overhead, while also being instantly friendly to newcomers and making basic programs look as simple as a scripting language.

Intermission

Before we go ahead improving tiny bits of the language that we've got, we are taking a brief pause to review our original goals and design a more concise and powerful syntax. And then improve the compiler towards that goal.

We want to add to the language:

1. Dedicated first-class syntax for message handlers and message interfaces.
2. No-boilerplate serialization compatible with TL-B.
3. Fully automated load/store for the contract state.
4. Gas/value requirements in the interfaces.

We will rewrite common contracts in hypothetical Tact 1.1 and then come back with a concrete roadmap on how we build towards that.  [#285](https://t.me/tactlang/285)
[2022-09-06T00:14:20] **Dmytro Polunin**: Currently, there are no up-to-date documentation or specification, but we work in this direction, and if nothing is happened, I guess we will release something for reading in the next 1-1.5 monthes.
